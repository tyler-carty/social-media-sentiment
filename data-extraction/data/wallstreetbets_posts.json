They aren't the only ones shitting the bed, other hedge funds are noticing and don't want the same thing to happen to them.

No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70. Today your hearts and those short selling un-American sons of bitches banking on an American company failing are screaming \"It won't make it back to 100, sell\". And you turn to WSB as this is where it all began for you. You look for help. You look for a sign. Here's your answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDIAMOND FUCKING HANDS. HOLD. FORGET.

Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on. \n\nToday may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. \n\n2 questions - why and how. \n\nThe how is easier to understand so let\u2019s start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. \nWith GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it\u2019s going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don\u2019t want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. \n\nI\u2019ve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday\u2019s... every day. \n\nEvery day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. \n\nTo participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. \n\nA squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. \n\nThe short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. \n\n\nNOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow. \n\nWe have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently. \n\nBest of luck my fellow retard.",

Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.\n\nLong periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.\n\nKnow  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;\n\n* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.\n* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.\n* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation\n* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.\n* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.\n* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**\n\nI own 111 GME shares @ $53.\n\nI don't do options because I am but a simple man.\n\nI'm holding till the only thing left of the shorts is the outline of their shadows on a wall.\n\nSee you on the moon you beautiful bastards.",

That increases the number of buyers, which is literally making everyone holding the stock richer.\n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong, but if every individual here says GME is going to 400 and no one sells until it gets there, the big money gets f'ed. the short sellers get squeezed out and along the way which speeds up the run to get us to 400.\n\nBUY AND HOLD!!!\nYou don't gain or lose anything until you sell! \nIgnore the swing ( im rich but now I'm poor).

After looking at this I\ndon\u2019t know how a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze of a squeeze stays below 4-digits.\nHere is some proof of this point \u2013 it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.\nVolume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Let\u2019s go back again to the available\nfloat 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been\ntraded 5 times. There\u2019s just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know\nDFV didn\u2019t sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didn\u2019t get sold and bought 5\ntimes. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.\n\n>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer\nshares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on\ngamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to\ncover their calls. But there weren\u2019t enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to\nclose a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again.

Shareholders just need to sit back, wait, roast some marshmellows, and not sell. That turns into a painful and hefty interest payment for them.\n\nIf that spike to $150 today was a gradual cover and then reshorting (which I suspect it may have been) - we only need to look at the last margin/squeeze when the price his 70 and dropped back down. That means the next price target might run up to $300 (holy shit) before we hit another margin call/cover/squeeze back down - because it seems like they are willing to lose 100% of their short position before they even think about covering.\n\n1. That is obviously unsustainable.\n2. They could have given up today at $150. They chose not to. Keep that in mind.\n\nIf the price holds above 80 by the end of the week, a whopping 81,400 contracts (Source: Fidelity Open Interest) will exercise ITM, dealing another gamma like squeeze we saw friday/monday. If it goes higher than $115 - it could be nuclear liftoff at that point. I had no idea what to expect on monday (today) - but I didn't expect 90's when I woke up for premarket.\n\nThe volatility will get insane. Strap in, hold on to your butts, because (i posted about this earlier) - this could be a long, drawn out battle. If shares are as unavailable as everyone is reporting, Melvin and co will cotinue to gamblers fallacy their money straight into retail pockets.\n\nPos: 1100 shares CB.36, 28 contracts all deep ITM (25-52 strike).edit: not advice, I'm holding, do as you please.  \n\n\nEdit: Also - Melvin's shareholders are in a three year lockout agreement - meaning they can't pull their money until he says so, or it goes to 0. There may be some other terms, obviously I'm not privy to the contract, but that 3 year lock-in is widely reported. That means, depending on how stupid they want to be, being down 30% already on the year (4 BILLION DOLLARS) - they have another $8billion to go AUM, AND the $2.75 billion Citadel loan.",

(For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).\n\n* The number of shares short is still above 68M. \n\n* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. \n\n* This is 155% of the float. \n\n* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)\n\nA number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That\u2019s roughly 6.5M users. And, that\u2019s only RH users. Let\u2019s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). \n\nIf we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that\u2019s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that\u2019s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it\u2019s 5 shares, that\u2019s 85% of the float. I don\u2019t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. \n\nWhat does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. \n\nThat means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail\u2019s shares. They have to have your bananas. \n\nAnd, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That\u2019s the squeeze. \n\nDon\u2019t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk. We have no ongoing expense of ownership. The market made sure of that. So, let their actions slit their own throats. \n\nDon\u2019t sell.  If you do, buy back in. Don\u2019t let up. \n\nAnd, don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m an idiot. You probably shouldn\u2019t listen to anything I say. \n\n(Finally, if someone has better information, numbers, or analysis - correct me.)",

Yes. Some higher up WSB chads that are long players are gonna be millionaires. But this is about discovering if we have a free market or not. This will be a catalyst for something.

The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold \u2014> price goes down \u2014> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place \u2014> price drops even more \u2014> they keep doing that \u2014> price drops lower every time \u2014> but as long as we hold they weren\u2019t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don\u2019t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!\n\nFurthermore don\u2019t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022\t\u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. \u2022\t\u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \u2022\t\u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80",

They maybe bought another few days of capital to try to pay the interest on their shorts.\n\nJust remember we can hold longer then they can pay the interest on their shorts. It is killing them we've all been seeing the numbers. Billions a day. But DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF IT DOES NOT POP TOMORROW. WE CAN STAY HOLDING LONGER THEN THEY CAN STAY SOLVENT",

                "body": "Credit [u/PlayFree_Bird](https://www.reddit.com/u/PlayFree_Bird)\n\nOkay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:\n\nYesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.\n\nYesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.\n\nLast night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\nToday, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\nAt approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\nTwo minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\nThe trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nEdit1: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit2: I wish I was Elon's adopted asian child\n\nEdit3: we like the stock\n\nFull Casino?

This event is not caused solely by corporate greed, it is the first instance of people truly fighting back against the system we are in. \n\nWhy should the rich manipulate the markets when they feel like? Why should the free market fail due to government bail outs, monopolies, and back door deals?\nOur response here has created a truly unprecedented scenario. We are proving that the market is not a playground for billionaires to shove us around. \n\nThere is something simple that at some point we, the people have forgotten. \nWE are the market. WE are the law. WE are the foundation of society. \n\nWhile we have been attacking each other and getting divided by politics, sex, race, and every other thing that we disagree on, we have allowed the corruption and inequality to destroy us as human beings. \n\nThe world right now is watching us, it is watching what will happen. Because if the current economic system is toppled like this, if we show we are just as capable of gaining wealth, we have the potential to end this \u2018work culture\u2019 that has destroyed our ambition and creative nature.\n\nWhat then, will happen if this is shut down? Then the government has proven that it supports the rich over the many. In that case we MUST fight back. To be shamed like that is inconceivable. \n\nWe are not children, we are not blind. Not anymore. We know about the corruption and we know we can fight it. \n\nHold GME, buy GME. It is the first step in what will be a revolutionary time for the future. \nThe world is watching us, as it should be. Watch and learn. The time for being subservience unto the super rich is over. \n\nWar is no longer solely fought on the battlefield. Every person here is involved, you all have a part to play. \n\nIgnore the media, ignore the ploys. Focus on your \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \nI am not an investment manager, I am but a humble dumbass who really likes this stock \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army.

I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022 \u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022 \u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. \u2022 \u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022 \u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \u2022 \u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD.

The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate \"GME21\", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Andrew Left takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat night, I bow to my framed photograph of /u/deepfuckingvalue before falling asleep, a soft smile on my face, optimistic and excited for what awaits me tomorrow.",

This text will be the most important piece that you\u2019ll see today!!!\n\nThey  didn\u2019t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold \u2014> price goes down \u2014> the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place \u2014> price drops even more \u2014> they keep doing that \u2014>  price drops lower every time \u2014> but as long as we hold they weren\u2019t  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don\u2019t believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!\n\nFurthermore  don\u2019t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022  \u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022  \u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question. \u2022 \u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022  \u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days. \u2022 \u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80",

Hedge funds pay for your orders so their high frequency trading algorithms can adjust accordingly, maximizing the amount of money they steal from you. \n\nThe reason they are so pissed off is because we are HOLDING. There is NO order flow other than $10,000 sell limits. They have no idea what to do because the data they pay for isn\u2019t there. They can try to run algorithms on Reddit, but our information is too delayed. When I BUY and post \u2018bought more\u2019 it\u2019s too late for the algorithm to make a decision. When I HOLD, the algorithm breaks down because it flashes some insane amount of loss when they have to cover their short positions since there\u2019s no order flow. \n\nYesterday was their attempt to find another way to rig the game because they\u2019ve completely lost control of the thing that\u2019s been used to steal money for years. \n\nTHIS IS NOT MY FUCKING PROBLEM, I LIKE THE STOCK AND IF YOU GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO ROB ME, MAYBE ITS TIME FOR A NEW CAREER. \n\nBUY AND HOLD.",

That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.\n\nOn Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the \"BUY\" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.\n\nWhat happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!\n\nBecause these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.\n\nThey know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.\nWE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.\n\nOn Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's \"too risky\", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.\n\nThey know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.\n\nTHAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!\n\nWe're living in a timeline where the most retarded community on the entire internet has a chance to be the ones that take down the biggest assholes living on this earth, and literally change the financial world forever. ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHARES!!!\n\nFuck the moon, we got the gas the get to Andromeda. Are you willing to come along for the ride and make history? DON'T SELL!",

There's more than electricity on this board right now, there's real, actual ***energy***.\n\nOld internet was alive with possibility and pure, unhindered creativity. We didn't have stringent mods, repressive ToS, or platform identities limiting us. We weren't split up by politics and misinformation, so we just did whatever made us happy in the moment. It was always just \"us\", the internet nerds, banded together in our own little sphere of influence that other people didn't even want to bother to penetrate. We could make whatever we wanted a reality, and logging on to your favorite websites was always a dive into a pool of infinite possibility.\n\nI'm new here, but the way WSB has banded together over these past two weeks has completely captured that spirit: The idea that random idiots on the internet working together can make something truly special, and that's not just at the core of the internet; it's at the very core of the human spirit. THAT's the energy you're feeling right now. \n\nRaw, unmitigated possibility, and it's beautiful to behold. \n\nGod speed everyone. May we never forget these days.",

If you can\u2019t stand to lose money, you shouldn\u2019t invest or you invested more than you were willing to lose.\n\nIf you\u2019re a real holder, you\u2019re waiting to see what happens. I hold 55 shares of GME at $224.\n\nEdit: Holy cow I\u2019m getting ripped apart in the comments lol. Yes the point is also to make money, and I\u2019m here out of principle.\n\nEdit 2: The main reason I bought so much is that I was so frustrated and upset by Citadel\u2019s and Robinhood\u2019s actions as well as those by other brokerages. If you don\u2019t believe me, then I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\n\nEdit 3: I just like the stock\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

If you invested what you couldn't afford  then get out when you feel comfortable but if you can afford then hold. I mean why not you can afford it. This isn't a get rich quick scheme the market has to play out. We are playing by their rules and as such they know the rules and how to bend them. They stand to loose more than we as a collective stand to gain. They aren't going to take this laying down they are going to fight and you must fight back and remain strong know that when you see red so does everyone else that bought in.

I have seen a lot of people panic and that is not good. So a little recap, we saw prices drop from 115 to 78 very quickly. I think that a lot of short sellers doubled down and shorted even harder than before.  In effect, their mission was to drop the price of gme as fast as possible. NYSE then announced that they could no longer short shares of GME for 30 days. Now, that tells me a whole hell of a lot of shares were shorted and we will not know until the 15th with exact numbers. That needs to be a take away, the hedge bros risked it all to kill the price, and it worked, but the method of shorting even harder to kill the price is no longer on the table. NYSE said nope. So now the short percentage could be huge, we do not know. We have all the leverage, we own the shares in cash. So if you are currently panic selling, may I ask why you are not calm? The hedge bros sent their worst, all they can do now is PUT OPTIONS. Let me repeat PUT OPTIONS. They shorted so hard today they are no longer allowed to short. We own the shares, why are we panic selling? The battle should be over by now. I am currently at a loss, but I am calm and I believe if everyone take a step back at what happened today they will realize that we are not losing. In fact we made them double down on shorts. Ya know the same thing that hurt them the first time. So drop a comment, let me know why you feel the need to contribute to the hedge bros needs. The line is only as strong as you are.\n\nTake the time to consider, this needs to be put in light",

I still don't have enough to start a business even though I kept my nose clean. I live in a banana republic of a shithole of a country and the game is rigged here like the rest of the world.\n\nWhen the GME news broke out early January, I scrounged up all the spare cash and savings I was willing to lose and applied for foreign banks and brokers. I punched the wall as the price went up while I was being verified when I could've bought in otherwise. When I got in, my average was high (but I averaged down earlier), and continue to hold with you beautiful bastards.\n\nThe thesis and maths on the GME play were sound. I just didn't count on Robinhood and other brokers cutting off natural demand and stifling momentum\u2014while big hedge funds could continue trading and laddering/covering. But I was already in last Thursday. I have no personality to file suit so for those in the class action, bleed them dry for me and please find a tougher broker.\n\nIf I lose it all, it'll be fine. I'm covered and will continue with my third world shitty status quo of a life. But GME will probably be my one shot to get out of this shithole existence. Maybe if this all plays out well I can finally tell mom to stop working, I can finally put my sisters into good schools, and I can finally afford decent stuff. \n\nI don't want to die like every other lame bloke.\n\nI'm holding with the rest of you until the stars. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32",

If they had to cover 69 million shorts and the short interest (falsely reported I believe) is at around 50% rn - they would have had to cover 35 million shares since 1/26. CNBC claimed shorts covered on 1/27, a day when the price was high 200s to mid 300s all day - had they actually been covering the price would be rising all day and continue to rise. The next day (Thursday) was clear ladder attacks with the low volume and the swings from 400s to 100s. Why would they do ladder attacks if they had covered their shorts? They have nothing to gain from that unless their shorts weren\u2019t actually covered.   Anyone have any thoughts?",

Having a stick at 80 and a chain that goes to 800 let's you create several of these that are almost guaranteed to pay (if you're bearish) and the higher ones will protect you from the lower ones.\n\nYou do need a lot of money to do it, in this case the 700/800 requires nearly 10k available. But institutions have that, and credit and they basically just get finance to approve the risk at this point.\n\nI'm not convinced calls mean anything other than protection for complicated combinations.\n\nLet's hope I'm wrong.",

        "text": "**OK LISTEN UP**\n\nShorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. \"Like what?\" you may ask...\n\n1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)\n\n1. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price... \n\n a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). \n\n b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today\n\n1. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.\n\nThis is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.\n\ntldr; hold, buy more, whatever. Don't fall for their shit. GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

I don't believe this is true at all.  \n\nIt really has been interesting watching the amount of propaganda out there trying to make you think that you are an idiot if you still have GME shares.  I guarantee you that DFV still has holdings in this company and understands the short position.\n\nPlease see a portion of this video that I discovered that really goes into some of the mathematics of the actual proportion of the shorts that the hedge funds were sunk into GME.  Eventually they must rip the band-aid off and buy back their positions short.  The video was a livestream so its long and not straight to the point.  But the math info is legit.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/izQgn5wMJiE?t=1713\n\nYou can't make a post anywhere else in the sub if it relates to GME in a positive aspect.  It's actually crazy.

What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?\n\nWe don\u2019t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don\u2019t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don\u2019t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children\u2019s college funds away just to post memes about it.\n\nYour plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven\u2019t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.\n\nDouble down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. \n\nTake all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.",

Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains. \n\nROBINHOOD- doesn\u2019t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading. \n\nDIPS- don\u2019t freak tf out if GME dips $20 pre market. That is not significant. Especially when we opened yesterday at $44. So calm down plz. \n\nHope this helps you make smarter decisions on our way to the moon. Cheers and have fun \ud83e\udd42",

Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains.\n\nROBINHOOD- doesn\u2019t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading.\n\nDIPS- don\u2019t freak tf out if GME dips $20 pre market. That is not significant. Especially when we opened yesterday at $44. So calm down please.\n\nHope this helps you make smarter decisions on our way to the moon. Cheers and have fun \ud83e\udd42\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFubar",

It\u2019s normal so don\u2019t let it scare you. Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains.  \n>  \n>ROBINHOOD- doesn\u2019t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading.  \n>  \n>DIPS- don\u2019t freak tf out if GME dips $20 pre market. That is not significant. Especially when we opened yesterday at $44. So calm down plz.  \n>  \n>Hope this helps you make smarter decisions on our way to the moon. Cheers and have fun \ud83e\udd42",

Do you really think they'd only spend a couple thousand bucks hiring and paying people to make such low effort comments?\n\nThe smart move on their part would be to flood us with tons of low effort comments so we think that's all they're doing, meanwhile make posts that seem like legit DD to get us to expect a squeeze today, or a certain share price (cough, $800, cough) to happen today so that if that doesn't happen today we'll see a huge sell off of paper handed apes at the end of the day who don't want to hold into after hours and over the weekend.\n\nWe really need to keep bringing up that absolutely nothing may happen today and that even a dip might happen. We need to remember that we may also shoot to $800+ and that if that happens they may have started that price idea or spread it around because they figure if they can get people to start selling there it will drive the price down rapidly again.\n\nWe don't know what their game is. But we do know they love money and do you really think they'd only be spending a pittance on trying to throw us off our game with these bots/shills that take no effort?",

Love the self deprecating jokes and the commitment to the noble cause of taking down the hedgies and their bs naked shorts. Been a casual trader for ~20 years - my dad taught me everything he knew starting when I was a kid. He's passed now, but he fucking HATED how brokerages fuuuuck over the little guy investor, and instilled that hatred in me. As I grew up and got more astute at investing, he and I developed a strategy of finding deep value, buying, and holding (often for years). That strategy ultimately paid off all my university debt. Here I am decades later finding a community with a similar approach, and an even greater resolve. Now I'm part of this vietnam-style guerilla war against the metaphorical american invader shorts. We're poorly trained, poorly funded, but have a singular purpose and a clear and simple marching order that will win: Buy. Hold. Repeat.

So I went and looked at the option chain.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are 3358 call options at the $100 strike price. So if the stock closes above $100 today, these calls will finish ITM, and MMs will need to purchase 335,800 shares. That would be bad for the shorts so they're doing everything they can to keep the price below that.\n\n  \n\n\nOther price points above $100 with 1k or more call options:\n\n *  $120 (1150 call options)\n *  $130 (1623 call options)\n *  $140 (1114 call options)\n *  **$150 (3064 call options)** \n\nThere are more but I'm lazy\n\nSo I expect downward resistance every $1 increment until $115 then every $5 after that.\n\n  \n\n\nSomeone with 2 wrinkles...

        "text": "How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]\n\nRobinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.\n\nHere\u2019s a trick that ~~will work.~~\n\n**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **\n\n1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).\n2) Scroll all the way down the call list.\n3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).\n4) Immediately exercise.\n\nI just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.\n\nBest of luck out there! Let\u2019s get them!!!\n\nP.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can\u2019t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~\n\n_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.\n\n_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) This works for pretty much any stock.\n\n2) There\u2019s a catch. You need enough money (please don\u2019t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nExample:\n\n- $GME is $300\n- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000\n- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).\n- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)\n\nAfter exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",

And if you've been irresponsibly trading options long enough, you know - sometimes it does, and your -90% position goes to +200% in minutes based on a tweet from Trump or Elon or some other random factor. Well get it through your head that these are fucking SHARES. They don't expire, there's no theta decay, and they don't require a perfectly timed miracle to regain value.

Calm your tits and act like the degenerate gamblers you are instead of flipping out because you're losing money on a trade. THAT'S NORMAL HERE REMEMBER??\n\nNewbies, volatility is the bread and butter of WSB. If your portfolio isn't fluctuating wildly in one direction or the other on an hourly basis, or if you don't want it to, go hang with r/investing. Buy into some bonds and mutual funds and retire at 67 with just enough to maintain a living wage until you die. But that's not what this place has ever been about. The endgame has ALWAYS been yacht or food stamps, this isn't new. A few get rich, most go broke. But everyone who goes broke does it with dignity while trying to get rich, and most importantly posts loss porn for us all.\n\nWhat's gonna happen to all these stocks? I have no fucking idea. I'm holding my GME because if there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that no matter what I'm trading the second I sell for a loss, the shit miraculously recovers.

Clever apes understand, and no need for autist apes to do the same: just follow the clever apes.\n\n\u2018Phantom shares\u2019 drive real shares out of the market - into hiding. Like Gresham\u2019s Law for currencies: bad money drives good money out of circulation. Zimbabweans know this.\n\nEventually, however, the bad stuff becomes worthless and then the real stuff becomes precious.\n\nYou hold your GME till the bad stuff is exposed and worthless. No matter how much you are tempted to exchange your precious GME for shit.\n\nThe longer you hold your GME, the more \u2018real\u2019 it becomes because of T+2 settlement rule and other rules. The more the system MUST identify you as the actual owner of real shares, not phantoms.\n\nThis is a game of time, not price.\n\nEdit: many thanks for the kind awards. It took me a long time to sift out the wheat from the chaff. I forgot to post position: about 1300 shares of GME in 2 separate brokerages. Dunno the average price and don\u2018t care. I fretted about the red till I realised it does not matter.\n\nEdit: edit. Sent this Tweet to Janet Yellen just now. @ JanetYellen.  Please do your job tomorrow. The SEC must enforce the laws and rules on naked short selling of stocks, and \u2018failure to deliver\u2019. It is unacceptable to shut retail traders out of the market but simultaneously allow other participants unrestricted access. Shameful.\n\nEdit:edit:edit. @ JanetYellen Good morning from London, England. People have been asking the SEC to investigate naked short selling, failure to deliver and collusion or market manipulation on Wall St. for years. Now the SEC is scanning social media for evidence of the same? Do your job please.",

GameStop has exclusive deals with Microsoft. We could potentially see a shift in GameStops business structure, maybe even its name. I believe GameStop will become a premium software distributor rather than just video games. Can it compete with Amazon? ABSOLUTELY. The gaming industry has not seen the e-commerce side yet.\n\nPre-Market volume is looking GOOD. These all look like authentic purchases from retail investors. To be honest the only reason why GameStop had poor earnings was because of the pandemic and nationwide lockdowns. \n\nI hope this helps\n\nEdit: Additional Info\n\nJanet Yellen is also meeting with the SEC to look at any criminal activity involved with \u201cmeme\u201d stocks.

That is when you get to make it all work.\n\nI have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.\n\nI know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.\u201c\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

The only question is what broker do you use .

New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.\n\n\\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.\n\n\\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!\n\nThere's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now\n\n*Edit*\\--*corrected to say SI report comes out tonight, thanks for pointing that out*\n\n*Edit--Added in the bit about Conan, thanks to Alexis418 for pointing that one out!*",

During a shortsqueeze the daily stock value isnt an important or interesting metric.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe interesting metrics are: - Volume (should be low on down spikes) - Short interest - Short vs float - Short percentage - Catalysts that provoke a need to cover and other such indicators of scarcity of stock supply.\n\n\u200b\n\nNothing else matters. **The importance of the pricepoint between now and the squeeze is seriously almost ZERO. Green days dont matter, nor do reds.**\n\n\u200b\n\nI know you smooth brains are used to looking at \"green good\" \"red bad\" AND that you all have the attention spans of hamsters which makes you question valid DD because \"why no print money yet, boring\" but with volume so low and so little circulation its easy to make the line do funny things.\n\n\u200b\n\nKnow the DD, and know what a fucking shortsqueeze is and how it works before you panic about nothing. Its actually dangerous being uninformed. It leads you to make poor (financial) decisions, opens you up to being receptive to misinformation and unintentionally makes you have a bad effect on the mindset of others that are also less than optimally informed.\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring or leading up to the point of a shortsqueeze it is NOT buying that gets the price up like in normal market situations. So dont focus on it\n\n\u200b\n\nDont beg for whales to come help buy.\n\nDont beg DFV to post (for some reason?!)\n\nDont look at red numbers and doubt the underlying DD that you did before investing (Right? RIGHT?)\n\nDont overcelebrate green moments or days like Jesus' second coming.\n\n\u200b\n\n**The moonshot in a shortsqueeze situation comes from endless demand impulse when shorts are required to cover, combined with unavailability of shares to do so with because theyre owned by shareholders. This means that holding a certain percentage suffices, although increasing also increases pressure and squeeze leverage.**\n\n\u200b\n\nIn such a situation a bullshit instant gratification attitude would be bad. I encourage everyone who has invested or is planning to actually read up on what a shortsqueeze is because otherwise you'd falsely assume everyone is just randomly shouting \"hold\" and \"it will come\".\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is not financial advise. It is simply a plea for you people to inform yourself, so that you are able to make better individual personal decisions",

The delta value is sitting at .6 when they do this, so they hedge these calls and buy 60 shares  around the $40 market price for each call they sold at $60 strike. As the price goes closer to $60, delta gets closer to 1 so they buy more shares at prices lower than $60 so they don\u2019t lose their ass. As more MMs buy to cover their hedge, momentum picks up, buying intensifies and now you\u2019re in a gamma squeeze where you have a ton of MMs buying to hedge their positions. Price blows past the strikes and now there is more buying at a loss. They will probably short the fuck out of this in the AM but given the attention GME has gotten, it\u2019s gonna be harder for them to naked short sell and we are probably going to see the real squeeze.

                "body": "Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying \"it's about to moon! Here we go!\"\n\nNobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90 need to understand this and help all the \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udd90 retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.\n\nWatch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.\n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\n\nAdditional details\n\nIf you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",

But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.\n\nBut I think its essential to remember this\n\n**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**\n\nIn a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.\n\n**This is NOT what is happening now.**\nThe price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down \n\n**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**\n\nUNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.\n\n**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**\n\nDont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.\n\nNot financial advice. I own 3 pets, I am not smart. You are responsible for your own decisions. I am just commenting on a market situation. Im an idiot",

My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.\n\nWent on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that \"significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security\" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally \"Mason,\" answers.\n\nGeneral Summary of our conversation:\n\n\"Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?\"\n\nMason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.\n\nMe: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.\n\nMason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.\n\nMe: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?\n\nMason: No.\n\nMe: Okay . . . what limit order am I \"allowed\" to place?\n\nMason: \\*hesitates\\* It has to be within 100 points.\n\nMe: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm \"allowed\" to set for a limit order?\n\nMason: $150 is the max.\n\nMe: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.\n\nMason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!\n\nMe: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.\n\nMason: ......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?\n\nAnd why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?\n\nEdit: Mason was so aggressive, so defensive. I didn't anticipate that. I also don't understand why someone would be that aggressive",

I am a poor motherfucker and I yolo'd everything I could spare. 150 dollars. Into GME. I borrowed another 70 from a friend just so I could get 2 at 110. And I honestly didn't care if it took off or not. I simply wanted to watch wall street sweat and be a part of the movement that shed light on the shady shit that goes on there. I was totally prepared to watch it ride to zero and just count it as the cost of revolution. So I've held this whole time. I considered averaging down at $43 but I really couldn't afford it if it tanked further so I didn't.\n\nI was one of the late joining bag holders. It took me a while to get my fidelity account setup and ready I wanted in before Jan 27/28 but couldn't get my funds approved and transferred and settled before then. This is giving me hope again. Hope that I'll recoup my investment in addition to the exposure that came from this which was my real reason for getting into it. Yea I wanted to make some money too but, I'd never considered stocks before this. Thank you retards so much for all the posts these last weeks. I lurk here and read and rarely post. Sincerely hope this takes off and I can make at least what I put into it and maybe more! Ty so much guys! Obligatory Rocket Emjois! (I'm on computer and don't know how to make them.)",

They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43. Now it's back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock.

They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43. Now it's back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize we aren't going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more we own, the more we control the price we're willing to sell it for. We have gained a ton of ground today even if it doesn't look like it on the price. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying \"it's about to moon! Here we go!\" \n\nWe don't know how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as we maintain upward pressure, and buy hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90 You need to understand this and help all the \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udd90 retards FUDing about understand it too. \n\nWatch this chart like a hawk.

Blackrock and Vanguard are heavily bullish on GME and have purchased a bazillion shares each. Oh and Roaring Kitty doubled down from 50k to 100k shares just the other day. He predicted GME a year before everyone else, he's an intelligent individual, he must have good reason for his decision.  \n\n2. the hedge funds which are bearish on GME has kept their shorts open... either directly in GME or through ETFs which are highly weighted with GME. \n\n3. the hedge funds which has kept their shorts open are losing alot of money each day simply due to the interest rate alone. \n\n4. A number of catalyst events may kick off another rally. \n\n5. If the stock does rally, hedge funds may be greedy enough to open another short at the top, creating a game theory scenario where the cycle of rallying and shorting happens again and again, leading to the potential for huge profits. \n\n6. The price is so low now at \\~$40 that the risk-profit ratio is heavily tilted towards profit. eg. If you put in $100, yes you risk losing it all, but if GME explodes and say 10x, you'll profit $1000. Sounds like a fun and worthwhile gamble to me. \n\n7. GME beat the market last friday & volume has been so low recently indicating the majority are currently holding. \n\n8. Even if the short-squeeze-rally doesn't happen, there has been change of management to capitalise on this recent publicity. Ryan Cohen is urging the board to pivot GME from a brick-motar company to an E-commerce platform. They've already hired an ex-Amazon vet as the chief technology officer. Even if the squeeze doesn't happen, GME might happen to be a good long term hold anyways. I want to give this company a chance. I remember in recent times how the whole world was screaming TSLA would fail... \n\n9. The political and historical context of GME is unprecedented. For the first time, we're seeing the influx of \"Kamikaze\" investors into GME. The type that doesn't care if they lose their profits. They want to make a statement against the financial system & how the HFs profited in 2008 to the detriment of millions of honest folk such as pensioners losing their retirement funds.",

(Technically 47 shares reported prior to market open on shortableshares - IBorrowDesk did not report any shares the entire day).\n\nSince then the volume of shortable shares has increased to 600,000 BUT the fee to short these shares has increased from 0.8% on 2/24 to a whopping 12.78% as of 10:00am today representing a nearly 1,500% increase.\n\nNow, my smooth brain doesn't fully comprehend all the implications of this.

        "title": "GME Short Squeeze: Act II",
        "text": "Good day, fellow retards.  We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It\u2019s apparent by now that it\u2019s not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they\u2019re going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:\n\n\\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.\n\n\\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions\n\n\\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.\n\n\\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.\n\nMelvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it\u2019s very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they\u2019ve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.\n\nIf GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can we know this is likely true?:\n\n\\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering\n\n\\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above\n\n\\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.\n\n\\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they\u2019ll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn\u2019t cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it\u2019s costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nPositions: I own Shares\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional. This is not a recommendation.",

There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.\n\n**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.\n\n**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don\u2019t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest \u2260 Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float\n\n**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.\n\n**Edit 5:** I\u2019ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC.

I thought his message was so powerful that I asked him for permission to translate, post (can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him) and fuck his wife (ok didn\u2019t ask for permission) after and he agreed to ~~all~~ most of this wholeheartedly \u2013 like a true Autist. I am trying to catch the message \u2013 so don\u2019t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it\u2019s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.\n\nAs usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don\u2019t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).\n\n**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World \u2013 let me get this straight!**\n\nIn the coming days I don\u2019t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of \u201ethis is over\u201c, \u201ewe missed the squeeze\u201c, \u201eI am going to loose it all\u201c, \u201eentered at 320$ - I am doomed\u201c. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.\n\n**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**\n\nYou realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET \u2013 yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! \u2013 and follow DD posted by people with names like \u201eSHOW\\_ME\\_YOUR\\_ANAL\\_TITS\u201c? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry \u201eOne-Wish-comes-true\u201c show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn\u2019t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don\u2019t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments \u2013 this is about \u201eget rich or die trying!\u201c. This is not r/investing!\n\n**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**\n\nIf this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this \u201eSaudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts \u2013 but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now \u2013 could be though the next big thing \u2013 got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET \u2013 the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize \u2013 you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn\u2019t do if you like the system).\n\n**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? \ud83d\ude13**\n\nSo there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It\u2019s a fucking global movement now (or not \u2013 could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8eand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy \u2013 we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven\u2019t understand the concept or how this works \u2013 speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up \u2013 desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors \u2013 shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious \u2013 you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let\u2019s be fucking honest \u2013 most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody \u2013 I even don\u2019t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).\n\n**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**\n\nDeal with it \u2013 we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That\u2019s it. If we are right \u2013 this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock \u2013 do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought \u2013 hmmmm makes sense \u2013 I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \\[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don\u2019t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) \u2013 no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the \ud83d\ude80 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.\n\nSo please \u2013 no post without \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and if you want to fukn leave the party \u2013 leave \u2013 but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.\n\nP.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I\u2019d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  \u2013 I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e \n\nEdit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \\- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.\n\nEdit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\\_everyone\\_its\\_mark\\_cuban\\_jumping\\_on\\_to\\_do\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \\- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.\n\nEdit 3: Bought 5@103 \n\nEdit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)\n\nEdit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again. For whatever it's worth \ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 6: Thanks again for all the Awards and stuff. I can only reload in the morning. Was fun and maybe I am going to translate more in the future - if mods would consider to give me a copy cat \ud83d\ude3a flair it would be the icing on the cake.\n\nEdit 7: Obligatory salute to the one and only DFV and his \ud83d\udc8e balls. This guy will go all the way to the \ud83d\ude80 with us.",

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud\n\nHello,\n\nand I currently own shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.\n\nMy name is\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nPower to the players,\n\nu/Precocious Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. \"In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!",

Seeing Gamestop hold  at $420.69 was one of the most beautiful things I've witnessed. We  didn't get there by telling each other to sell out, we did it through  sheer retardation. I see comments about coordinated buying, but we  couldn't coordinate fixing a lightbulb if we tried.\n\nAnd  that is our strength over those hedgefund fucks.

And in this action they created synthetic shares into the market. But obviously no one cares on how much of synthetic shares are out there. SEC just don\u2019t give a fuck at all.\n\nAlso this action creates some short call position on HF. This shit will expire if they manage to drive stock price below call strike. And once those expires, HF is officially off the hooook (damn automod). \n\nThe cascading effect is that after expiration date, MM will loose up their hedge, meaning to buy back shares. This will result in squeeze. (Unless there is some black magic rule that forgives MM\u2019s naked shorts)\n\nThe other possible outcome is that stock price stays above call strike, MM will exercise those calls and force HF to deliver those shares, and this kicks the responsibility back to HF. (Maybe there is also some black magic rule that simply allow HF to fail to deliver and be forgiven forever)\n\nNow, the question is that are those MM stupid? Why will they take this transfer of responsibility? This is pretty much a giant bet between MM and HF.\n\nSo my guess is that retail investors will soon to discover the existence of those two above magic rules. And, retail will realize that, no matter what, retail is always the loser.",

Again, higher risk = higher returns but also losses and required time dedication.\n\n- If you're super into it and willing to put the time to understand stocks, then 100% into companies that actually have growth potential while managing your portfolio.\n\nHope that helps y'all.

If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a \"30 cent stock\" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.\n\nAll the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.\n\nI'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nSo let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:\n\n**# of Shares - Price**\n\nx 20 - $0.30c\n\nx 80 - $5\n\nx 400 - $20\n\nx 600 - $40\n\nx 900 - $60\n\nx 2,000 - $100\n\nx 5,000 - $150\n\nx 10,000 - $200\n\nx 30,000 - $300\n\nx 50,000 - $400\n\nx 150,000 - $500\n\nx 1 mil - $1,000\n\nx 15 mil - $5,000\n\nx 30 mil - $69,420\n\nGet it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.\n\nGet it?\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nThey need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.",

And $GME is plummeting because of Robinhood's buying restrictions.\n\nThe only hurdle right now is Robinhood's decision to limit $GME share purchases.

        "title": "GME possible upcoming catalysts",
        "text": "Upcoming GME \u201cPossible\u201d Catalysts\n\nThere are some great Due Diligence posts out there regarding the short percentage on GME, the hiding of the shorts game with An ETF that cannot be named here and other ETF\u2019s, and the AI model of where GME could moon at because of this.  I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in.  They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have.  These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail.  The high frequency trading, the media, and the schill accounts.\n\nWe all know why we are here, duh it\u2019s cause \u201cwe like the stock\u201d. Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about.  Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb. We don\u2019t know exactly what will start the frenzy. What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it\u2019s no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies.  So here is a list of certain key items coming up.\n\n1.  This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday.  Then it really hit when u/deepfuckingvalue followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares.  Fucking legend.  That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday.  A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares.  This \u201cmight\u201d be all the catalyst we need to see the moon.\n\n2. An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio.  If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares.  Honestly we don\u2019t know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME.\n\n3. GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th.  This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush.  In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter.  We also don\u2019t know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction.\n\n4.  Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting.  In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming \u201cHard to Borrow\u201d with additional rates and fees to borrow them.  The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.  You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting.  With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different.  I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons.  The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party.\n\nLike I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events.  Like it is repeated over and over again we don\u2019t know when the squeeze will occur because we don\u2019t know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies. All we know is when it happens hold on.\n\nThank you for reading, hope you are all well informed.  Please do outside research and don\u2019t rely on any one person as this is not financial advice.  I\u2019m just a fellow ape holding GME that\u2019s eats the crayons my wife\u2019s boyfriend brings me when he comes over.  I prefer the orange crayons. I am not a cat. I like the stock. I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it\u2019s great information however I don\u2019t have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria.\n\nObligatory \n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1b\ud83c\udf1b\ud83c\udf1b",

        "text": " \n\nThis is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I\u2019ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. \n\n**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don\u2019t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck \u201cdiamond handing\u201d, I\u2019m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I\u2019m trading GME. \n\n# Previous Important Posts\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous analysis.\n\n* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven\u2019t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close \n* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. \n* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. \n* [EndGame Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) covered the gamma squeeze, potential shady tactics by MMs, and some tips for staying safe. \n* [EndGame Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6y7om/gme_endgame_part_4_the_saga_continues/) covered the continued gamma squeezing and the resulting tenuous position of the \\~50M shorts that were still in GME. \n* [EndGame Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7clyl/gme_endgame_part_5_they_couldnt_win_so_they/) (deleted by mods, posted by someone else in comments) went into the implications of the absolute mindfuck trick the shorts pulled when they limited buying of GME (and other heavily shorted stocks)\n\n# Important External Reading\n\nThese three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**\n\n* Anatomy of a Short Attack - Seeking Alpha article from 2014.

That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that **not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms**, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\u201d\n   * \u201cWho controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC\u2018s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.\u201d**\n\n# History of shares and shorts on $GME\n\nHere\u2019s some history on GME that\u2019s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. \n\n* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME\u2019s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)\n\n* **GME used to be in the S&P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It\u2019s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&P.** \n* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78\n\n* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772\n\n* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  \n* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. \n* **There are many strange connections between DTCC\u2019s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood\u2019s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood\u2019s users had GME. \n   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.\n   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a \u201cturn off buying or else\u201d kind of arrangement. \n   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn\u2019t care about shooting down Robinhood. It\u2019s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. \n   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \\- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it \n      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you\u2019d know something interesting.** \n\n# Why GME went up\n\n* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. \n   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there\u2019s **high trading volume relative to total float**, it\u2019s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. \n   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) \n   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: \n      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was\n      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more\n      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them\n      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME \n   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That\u2019s why GME shot up. \n\n# The Big Reset\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. \n\n* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It\u2019s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. \n* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. \n\n# However, this is not the end for GME\n\n* Everything started with value on GME\n   * At $50, we\u2019re back to a value play. GME\u2019s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)\n   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we\u2019re not too far off from that right now. \n   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink \n* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) \n   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He\u2019s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he\u2019s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. \n      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen\u2019s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. \n   * **Regulatory involvement.** It\u2019s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. \n   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it\u2019s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. \n   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn\u2019t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. \n      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood\u2019s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on \u201cdowngrade\u201d under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** \n\n# How I\u2019m thinking about GME now \n\nThis is going to sound extremely strange, but **I\u2019ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can\u2019t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn\u2019t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I\u2019m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. \n\nNone of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of \u201cGME is another blockbuster destined for death\u201d is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. \n\nSince part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). \n\nI believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don\u2019t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m hoping for a further dip. I\u2019m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. \n\n# Suggestions \n\nThis is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. \n\nHere\u2019s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. \n\n* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that\u2019s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I\u2019m selling calls against my remaining shares. \n   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \\~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don\u2019t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of \u201cpennies in front of a steamroller\u201d but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**\n      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). \n      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. \n      * Two scenarios:\n      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d.\n      * \u201cDownside\u201d risks:\n* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don\u2019t fomo. \n* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it\u2019s an **attack vector** for you. \n* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn\u2019t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you\u2019re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. \n* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don\u2019t pay you for it, margin call you when you\u2019re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don\u2019t think the \u201cfree\u201d commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.\n* **Minimize regret; don\u2019t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares \u201cearly\u201d on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for \u201cmaximum profit\u201d led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.\n* **Don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I\u2019ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I\u2019ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. \n* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It\u2019s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you\u2019ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. \n* **Don\u2019t sell on dips.** You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.\n* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do your own DD. I\u2019m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.\n\n# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?\n\nOn February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I\u2019d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. \n\n## Dear Vlad,\n\n1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?\n\n2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?\n\n3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?\n\n4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME\n\n5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME\u2019s price rise again to $500/share or more? \n\n## Dear Kenny G,\n\n1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?\n\n2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?\n\n3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?\n\n4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?\n\n5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME\n\n6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?\n\n## Dear Plumpkin,\n\n1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity\n\n2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back\n\n3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt\n\n4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th\n\n5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital\n\n6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?\n\n7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?\n\n8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME\n\n9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise\n\n10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-\"R\"-T when they closed their short gme positions\n\n11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?\n\n12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?",

        "title": "A hedge fund managers perspective on GME",
        "text": "I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  \n\nGME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?\n\n1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.\n2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.\n3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  \n4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.\n5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other \"value\" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the \"hard to borrow\" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.\n\nImpossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.\n\nFor what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",

        "text": "Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,\n\nFirst \u2013 Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon\n\n**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**\n\n**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \\*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My opinion** is that Shorts don\u2019t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don\u2019t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \\*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \\*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. \u201cParticipants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in \u2018threshold securities\u2019 if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.\u201d \\[SEC Rule 204\\] (link below)\n\n**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \\*of failure to deliver\\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**\n\n**\\*\\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 & 6 at bottom for more details.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I\u2019M NOT FUCKING SELLING!\n\n**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**\n\n\\- Read below here if you can or care.\n\n1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?\n\nShorts weren\u2019t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn\u2019t good for them, but it isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \\*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\nIt takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \\*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\\*\n\nSo, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.\n\n2. How does that help the shorts?\n\nLower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.\n\nShorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.\n\n3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?\n\nI don\u2019t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.\n\n4. We\u2019ve heard this before. So what?\n\nI agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don\u2019t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\n~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.<- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don\u2019t count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \\*some of\\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \\*their own\\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se\n\n**Threshold Securities**\n\nDef: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for\n\n\u00b7 Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and\n\n\u00b7 Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and\n\n\u00b7 Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer\u2019s total shares outstanding.\n\nIf you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.\n\nRelevant links\n\nSEC - [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\nSee rule 204 \u201cClosing-out Requirements\u201d\n\nEdit: 'We must hang together or surely we shall all hang separately.' - maybe some smooth brain that has his face on money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   \"The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security\" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.\n\nSourced from [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235\\_88503](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235_88503)  \\- relevant section can be located with the find tool and typing \"98\". For me, it is 1 of 18. Clicking the 98 hyperlink will take you to a written example provided by the SEC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: If you feel this doesn't matter because the SEC won't enforce it then please consider contacting your representatives. Rules and regulations should be enforced. We can't encourage a lack of action just because things are hard or more complicated than we thought they would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**\n\nIn the post, I refer to \"The Shorts\" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.\n\n**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**\n\n~~Strikethrough~~ (removed) , \\* (added), and \"edit #\" are used to mark changes.",

Were you short Gamestop stock? Why did you bailout Melvin Capital and, within that question, what did you get for the money?\n\n2. Robinhood: If it wasn't a liquidity issue for your company, then why, precisely, did you stop the Gamestop folks from buying and only permitted them to sell? (They did ask the question, at least, of did he think restricting the buying affected the movement of the stock.) \n\n3. Robinhood / Citadel: Recent reports, specifically from Interactive brokers, have implied that this one stock, on this one week significant rise, may have in fact caused the market to collapse, can you explain why this would be? \n\n4. Melvin / Robinhood / Citadel: Pressing on a question that was asked, and as usual filibustered, why, exactly, should a stock be permitted to be shorted 140%? \n\nThe crux of the questions, really, should be aimed at understanding why the order flow matters and what they do with it. I suspect we know the answer but I want to hear them say it. \n\nThese hearings are worthless unless there are investigations into each of these firms. Funny how DVP is going to be sued but Citadel, Point 72, Melvin and Robinhood are not being investigated. \n\nPlease, tell me I'm not the only one who is still left yearning for answers on this....",

        "text": "Both sides have held their positions for a decade plus, at a complete stalemate. The trench warfare has led to distinct cultures and ways of life.\n\nShorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.\n\nGME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents\u2019 flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families. The vehicle of choice is a Tesla Short Bus, and everyone prays to Deep Fucking Value each night. He answers their prayers by holding, and they honor him by doing the same.",

Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday \n\nMy recommendation: \n1. HOLD\n2.

I used all my available income right now to buy AMC & BB as the only real viable alternative available to me in that moment.\n\nI will hold in the hope of a resurgence next week.\n\nIt is mad to think I have rarely worked less than 50 hours a week in my life yet I have less than a couple hundred spare.

So best thing to do is don't set stop losses or don't set them too close to the SP price. They then buy back those shares you just sold at the bottom of all the cascading sells and then stock pile and rinse and repeat all to make you get weak thinking the SP is tanking and make you want to sell. It's playing on your human emotion to their advantage when you see that big red line when in reality, it's just us hurting each other and they benefit buy buying back in cheaper to do it all over again.",

There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.\n\n**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.\n\n**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don\u2019t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest \u2260 Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float\n\n**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.\n\n**Edit 5:** I\u2019ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC.

        "text": "Let\u2019s break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when it\u2019s time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? \n\nAMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.\n\n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.",

If you're already sitting down then stand up, now sit back down. \n\nFirst off, *fuck your bitch and the clique you claim*, when I watch a movie I want to see it on a massive 70+ FOOT screen. You think I want to watch a gem like Frozen 2 on small bitch ass 60 inch TV screen with shitty ass TV speakers? No. I WANT THAT FUCKING BASS REVERBERATING THROUGH MY TESTIES AND IT TICKLE MY ANUS. Thats some good shit. I ain't getting this shit at home. My wife doesn't like losers who watch movies on small ass TV screens. That's why she's with her boyfriend right now. \n\nSecondly, I don't have a fucking fountain soda machine in my house. Im a poor retard who is trying to make a living like Steve Cohen. Nothing is better then sippin' that sweet carbonated nectar with a big fat bin of popcorn or a god damn pretzel. I also don't have an arcade section to kill time. SOME EVEN HAVE BARS. \n\nThirdly, this shit is 13$ right now. Severely under valued.    Its not the company's fault that shit stains suppressed this stock for years and prevented further growth. Its not the company's fault that covid fucked its business right in the ass. \n\nBut guess what, we have vaccines now! Covid is far from over but its only a matter of time until our wives respect us by watching \ud83d\ude80 Man on big ass fucking screens like we \ud83e\udd8d are supposed to. \n\nThey are embracing streaming like the chads they are:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357883/amc-universal-disney-streaming-warner-bros-mulan-tenet-theaters-movies\n\nChicago is opening up more theaters and as restrictions are lessened more will open up:\n\n\nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/amc-to-open-35-more-movie-theaters-across-illinois-friday/2423859/\n\nThey cut into their debt which means NO BANKRUPTCY!\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive-idUSKBN29Y03C\n\nThis is a 40$ stock, at the very least and when they're clicking on all cylinders it can go even FURTHER BEYOND.

I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it\u2019s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it\u2019s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.\n\n**GME** \\- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**BB** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**AMC** \\- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn\u2019t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.\n\n**NOK** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was \u201cbot\u201d propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.\n\n**Defining some terms:**\n\n**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)\n\n**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day\n\n**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)\n\n**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)\n\n**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n\\-Where did I get this chart from? [https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/most-active/stocks)\n\n\\-Which Stocks do I own? I own all 4 $BANG stocks\n\n\\-Which options should I buy? Buy shares\n\n\\-This is just my personal opinion and not professional investment advice",

Decades of oppression by big hedge funds, manipulating the market when they are wrong, taking advantage of the average investor...\n\nThis all needs to stop.\n\n\"If you're poor, just invest,\" they say.\n\nWell look at us now.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: for those looking for a broker to trade: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend\\_gme\\_thread\\_homework\\_for\\_all\\_lets\\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/)\n\nEdit 2: DON'T GET DISTRACTED, BUY GME OVER ALL THE OTHER STOCKS, BUT HOLD BB AMC AND NOK IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY GME",

        "title": "Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC",
        "text": "I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.\n\nTheir reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout \"market manipulation\" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).\n\nThe first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:\n\nMy screenshot (02/05/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98\n\nThe short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.\n\nRegardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on \"updating data\".\n\nI presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.\n\nHowever, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.\n\nRight, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.\n\nMy screenshot (02/06/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3\n\nAs you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).\n\nIn April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.\n\nI get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?\n\nThere was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff\n\nHere's the email he received.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7\n\nAgain, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.\n\nThoughts.\n\nP.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.\n\nP.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!\n\nEdit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn\u2019t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.\n\nAre you certain the chart isn\u2019t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I\u2019ll resolve your ticket but I\u2019m still here if you reply.\"\n\nI mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say \"oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more \"accurate\" measurements to our users\". Ya know?\n\n**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**\n\n**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.\n\nHis post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**\n\nAnd for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3\n\nThis is their response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5\n\nSo their excuse is a \"programming error\". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).\n\nI'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.",

Some folks feel like what it used to be won't still be there because of the influx of people and all that and that's valid. \n\nSo my question is would something like a standalone sub be something y'all would be interested in?

Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers.... the body I\u2019ve lost... the comrades we\u2019ve all lost... won\u2019t stop hurting... it\u2019s like they\u2019re all still there. You feel it too, don\u2019t you?\n\nCurrently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I\u2019ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we\u2019ll see a rebound. So I\u2019ll keep holding\n\nPosition: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too\n\nEdit: stop telling me to sell. I\u2019m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake\n\nEdit 2: to the guy who said \u201cAMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat\u201d but who\u2019s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it\u2019ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there\u2019s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less\n\n\nEDIT3: **Were going up after hours +2.18%** this is it boys *and girls*, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $420.69, here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "text": "To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday \n\nMy recommendation: \n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it\u2019s highest.",

Keep in mind, AMC\u2019s float is significantly larger than GME and with lower short interest so I don\u2019t expect another insanely parabolic move but this bet maximizes pay off if we somehow repeat. And if the selling pressure alleviates and we take off, another gamma squeeze is on the table. \n\nTldr: long 2/5 AMC 40 strike calls at 1.25/contract.\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 GME & AMC \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. I am expecting downvotes, I\u2019ll take them, but just wanted to share my play.\n\nEdit 2: I am receiving a lot of feedback which promotes continued long and concentration in GME and I would like to share some updates on why I think staying long GME is warranted and important. Based on latest data, as of today, AMC short interest is around 41% versus GME short interest around 95%. AMC SI increased day over day versus GME SI decreasing marginally day over day. Put differently, GME short positions are hurting more and has a higher probability of capitulation. Put retardedly, stay max long GME to secure tendies.",

As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.\n\nSort by VOLUME\n\n$GME  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)  \n29,097 contracts @ $800  \n10,905 contracts @ $200  \n10,418 contracts @ $150\n\nThis is HUGE volume.

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.\n\nThis does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).\n\nIt is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.\n\nThere is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.\n\nAMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.\n\nBB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.\n\nNOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.\n\nCatalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).\n\nEveryone have a great weekend.\n\nDisclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: fucked formatting",

I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.\n\nAMC is hyped and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.\n\nHere they are:\n\n* FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze\n* Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing\n* COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%\n\nI repeat this is not financial advice and I don't want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.\n\nIf you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.\n\nLove you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away!

        "text": "As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.\n\nAMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.\n\n****This is where we come in.****\n\nThe recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.\n\n>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.\n\n>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.\n\n>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.\n\n>It\u2019s been a wild ride for the nation\u2019s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.\n\nNow, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. \n\nThis movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. \n\nAnd the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.\n\nThis is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",

Melvin Capital (short seller) had allegedly received a few billion in emergency bailout funds from Citadel.\n3. Yesterday Robinhood brokerage betrays its own user base by turning off any ability to buy GME. You can only sell. It is speculated this was done to give hedge funds a huge unfair advantage.\n4. Allegedly, one of Robinhood's largest clients is actually Citadel.\n5. According to Justin Kan \"Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME\"\n6. Wall St. Goes Crazy. Lawsuits are filed, calls for Robinhood founders being put in jail.\n7. GME stock drops from $450 to below $150 per share\n\n8 An Avengers-Like Army assembles behind DFV. Names include Elon Musk, AOC, Mark Cuban, Justin Kan, and Dave Portnoy\n\n9. Trading is back today, premarket shares sit at over $400 and many speculate that we are entering the endgame.

        "title": "Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.",
        "text": "Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled \"Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers\". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.\n\n**The Mission Statement**\n\n\"GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \\[...\\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.\"\n\n**The Landscape**\n\n* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry\n   * \"The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.\"\n   * \"The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.\"\n* Valuable Assets\n   * Existing \"strong brand\" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.\n   * \"Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.\"\n   * Large retail and physical footprint.\n\n**The Roadmap**\n\n* Evolve into a Technology-first company\n   * \"Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.\"\n   * GameStop will have to \"begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers.\" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)\n   * GameStop will have to \"hire the right talent.\" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).\n* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform\n   * \"Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.\" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)\n   * Provide and expand \"larger gaming catalogs\" (Capture all games)\n   * Create \"community experiences\" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)\n   * Provide \"streaming services\" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)\n   * Support \"Esports\" (Expanding scene that is not going away)\n* Transition to Digital\n   * \"Industry developments in recent years\" include \"transition from physical hardware to digital streaming\" and the \"explosion of mobile.\"\n   * Expand \"digital content.\" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)\n   * Allow \"online trade-ins.\" (This would be a game changer)\n* Cut Excessive costs\n   * \"Cut its excessive real estate costs\" and \"identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.\"\n   * Streamline \"Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \\[...\\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.\"\n   * \"Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.\"\n\n**The Financials**\n\nAnalysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:\n\n* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.\n\nNote this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.\n\n**The X Factor**\n\nI believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that \"RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability.\" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.\n\nNotice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon\u2019s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.\n\nFurthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.\n\nSo degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.\n\nP.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.\n\n**TLDR; Ryan Cohen is Jesus. Buy and Hold $GME.**",

        "text": "I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.\n\nFirst of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.\n\nBut seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.\n\nWhen it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.\n\nIt's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.\n\nI felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.\n\nBut the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.\n\nGranted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.\n\nI commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.\n\nTLDR: felt like the new membership program was \ud83d\udd25, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.\n\nEdit:: Spelling from mobile, and to mention I do not currently have any shares as stated in one of the top comments. I do plan on picking shares up again. These are my current positions because I'm a newb poor boy. https://imgur.com/PFGNbeF",

After my post on Friday explaining why that day's dip wasn't problematic a lot of things have happened. Once again, **thank to everyone for holding the line**!!! And also thanks to **everyone who keeps buying into the cause**. Stay put (aka don't press the f\\*cking sell button)... Keep in mind, that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45,000 people who work at a company that was important in many people's childhoods - and soon will be relevant for future generations again. Without further ado, here are the updates regarding GameStop:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udcc5 A Summary of GameStop's moon mission\n\n***GENERAL INFORMATION***:\n\n* At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term (sorted by investment size): **Fidelity** (including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund), Daddy Cohen's **RC Ventures**, **Blackrock**, **Susquehanna**, the OG u/DeepFuckingValue, and of course us *fellow retards* \\- among others\n* GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the **WORLD'S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER**\n* The firm has huge potential for expansion (including in ecommerce) as the **video game market is valued at $160 billion dollars** with an estimated **Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.9%** (according to *Grand View Research).*\n\n***SHORT INFORMATION (Ortex Estimates; exact Updates not for another week)***:\n\n* *Estimated short interest*: \\~72 Million (decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY)\n* *Estimated short float*: still at \\~**101%+** (other estimates as high as 180%)\n* GameStop is still on the **SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days**\n* Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14.2%\n* Around 80% to 85% of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under $20  \u2757 \u2757\n\n***NEWS***:\n\n* Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working\n* Fidelity, IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated/limit margin on $GME (heavily limiting short sellers)\n* Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly $20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news. Having that said,  \ud83d\udc8e **\u270b s** saved the stock from a potential panic selloff\n* **Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday (1/17): Peanut Emoji & GIF saying \"So you're telling me there's a chance\".** The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze \ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\n* Multiple sources have confirmed that PC-Building Stations are coming in near future (mini microcenter-style)\n* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday\n* **$GS2C (Frankfurt) is up nearly 17% at the time** of writing this DD (on a NYSE holiday)\n* Webull and Etoro disabled shorting $GME\n\n***OTHER FACTORS***:\n\n* There are talks about **potential margin calls** (which would strongly affect shorts)\n* Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy\n* u/TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit's popular page (with 300+ awards and 11k+ upvotes) making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this. (This play has literally reached the Front Page of the \"Front Page of the Internet\")\n\n**News about GameStop seem to be never-ending. This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well. Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm, the bullish signs are overwhelming**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udd2e Outlook over the coming days:\n\n* Expect yet another highly **volatile day/week on the market**. Be careful with options at the moment; shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more...\n* There is no doubt that the **potential for another squeeze exists** (maybe even a legendary MOASS)!!!\n* Even if the squeeze does not happen (for whatever reasons) this stock is an **absolute value buy**, as many people before me have explained here. Another reason to go with shares rather than options!\n\n**As long as idiots don't \ud83d\udcc4\u270b there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udc3b Media Outlets, Melvin & other short sellers\n\nI feel like I am a broken record, but GameStop is here to stay. I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes.\n\nLet's take the example of KBIO's 10,000% squeeze:\n\n* KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike **GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast-growing space**. The childhood memories of most American's and brand recognition alone play a huge factor. Plus, their subsidiaries are solid as well!\n* **Fundamentals don't matter in these situations**... it's a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze, and now you have an unprecedented influence: bullish individuals who will never give up - aka us!\n* Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events:\n\n1. Shares are **massively over-shorted** (over 100% is banned by some governments for a reason)\n2. **Big news regarding the overhaul** of the firm (happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control)\n3. Forced **borrow recall** and/or margin removal (this already started)\n4. An actual squeeze happens as **panic breaks out** among short sellers - it's just a matter of time before someone starts folding (BTW, doubling down on shorts in this case is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze)\n\n* News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks. There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER. Now it's time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA. For institutional and retail short sellers alike: you may see the same consequences as $KBIO short sellers did - many of which went bankrupt. LONG POSITIONS are the way to go.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence. This is for educational purposes only.\n\nPS: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPPS: Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans. Even a small announcement relating to a technology-shift will slingshot-launch our moon mission. Maybe a potential for that happening as GameStop canceled appearance at ICR?? This is a big maybe, hence just a note as PPS...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 190 shares (for the long run), 5 1/22 $38c (very risky and make up full reinvestment of my calls that printed last week) - will buy more shares tomorrow morning\n\n# CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP, GAMESTOP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Over the weekend we have seen more bullish signs than anticipated. Even if we don't see a squeeze, we for sure have a value stock on our hands. $GME goes to the moon no matter what...\n\nEdit: GME Mexico is up 24.4% as of 12:15 ET \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: Cramer just tweeted saying we are already on the moon. Keep in mind he was wrong about $GME before - and we showed him!!! And guess what... we will fucking do the same thing again\n\nEdit 3: For the people who are tracking non-us GME: Mexico is up 40% and Frankfurt (aka Germany) is up 15.9% as of 1:15 ET \ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\n\nEdit 4: As of 4.45 PM, iBorrowDesk has reported a borrowing cost of 54.1% (a nearly 80% increase)",

An Emergency Shareholder Vote would mean eliminating all synthetic stock and taking leverage away from short-sales and a Reverse Stock Split would cause Citadel and any other phantom shares creators to be stuck holding their losses on their shorts position. This is the quickest way to help end this situation once and for all.\n\nYou can do this using the template below created by u/Whiplash51\n\nSubject : Fears of potential securities fraud\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is ----- -----, I am located in ----- and I currently own ----- shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n(your name)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull disclosure, I didn't come up with this idea, credit goes to both u/gnadami and u/Precocious_Kid for it, I'm just reposting with a template to help spread awareness about this and get more people in on it.\n\nEDIT: I've updated the post to include the template created by u/Whiplash51 since I think it sounds a lot more professional, additionally, u/canadian-brasilian suggests that we contact the largest shareholder of the company to ask them to call back all the short stocks. The largest shareholder is Fidelity Investments and you can contact them via their form linked below:\n\n[https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/contactus](https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/contactus)\n\nAnd for anyone wondering what the logic behind all this is, here's an article courtesy of u/johnjacobbtc explaining naked shorts, how they can be manipulated, and how a reverse split stock can help solve this issue.

        "text": "In the most recent update in the GameStop Saga GME has crashed from $450 per share to around $90 per share with a 50%+ crash yesterday.\n\nHere is Why:\n\nThe GameStop Short/Gamma Squeeze worked because we had 3 things on our side\n\n1. Surprise: We were underestimated in the capital we could bring to the table\n2. Focus: A huge focus of our readers was on a single Stonk\n3. Momentum: Fast growing crowd and upswing.\n\nHowever in the past few days we lost all 3.\n\n1. Surprise: The surprise was clearly gone, the second the news started reporting on us. This is theoretically ok as losing the element of surprise could be replaced by an increase in both focus and momentum. This was especially important because of the volume of short interest initially.\n2. Focus: Our bets went from a laser focus on a $200m GME to a spread out focus into AMC, NOK, Etc. This was when we needed the focus the most, as GME's market cap rose over $20 Billion\n3. Momentum: This was literally stopped dead in its tracks the second that the brokerages pulled our ability to purchase more shares. This is not something that we could have expected, it was a fundamental shift in the rules of the game, but it happened.\n\nThis is not to say GME won't or can't go to the moon, this is to say that in order for GME to move forward there would need to be a different set of elements that would need to come together.\n\nYou are welcome to hate on the post, disagree with my logic or just not agree with I am saying. But, for this and future plays I think it is important for people to be thoughtful of what caused the run up and where we are today.\n\nI'm not saying to buy or sell GME, but this is where I believe things stand.",

Every single big rally you saw was buyers stepping in, none of it was any major players covering.\n\nShort squeeze hasn't even BEGUN.

        "text": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html\n\nSEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver\n(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.\n\nMore than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.\n\nThe SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer\u2019s shares.\n\nGameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it\u2019s evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.\n\nShort sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren\u2019t known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.\n\n\u201cFails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,\u201d reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. \u201cTherefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or \u2018naked\u2019 short selling.\u201d\n\nFailures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there\u2019s also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.\n\nOne thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn\u2019t be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop\u2019s shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a \u201ccumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,\u201d according to the SEC\u2019s website.\n\nAbout 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.",

        "title": "GameStop Update 4: Weekend Recap",
        "text": "For those who missed it... Here is what happened this week.\n\n1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.\n2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.\n3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.\n4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.\n5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.\n6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share\n7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).\n8. Wednesday morning: \"We Like The Stock\". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350\n9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla\n10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.\n11. A Battle Cry is let out \"We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent\"\n12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m\n13. Here is where things get dark...\n14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.\n15. According to Justin Kan \"Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME\"\n16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.\n17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.\n18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.\n19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share\n20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.\n21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company\n22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.\n\nUntil Next Time... Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop",

The absolute best thing that you can do for the company from a business perspective is bring some stuff to trade, get the membership, and buy used. It also helps the employees there as they are HEAVILY pressured to meet these quotas.\n\nThis will probably get deleted anyway.\n\nRiding my 2 shared to Valhalla, intending to get more on Monday. \ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit: Um wait is that a gold?!

        "text": "Ok so this could be bigger than Mixer. Think about it. There\u2019s only two major live streaming platforms targeted towards gaming, Twitch and YouTube. I won\u2019t even mention Facebook streaming because that is something for \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bplus the YouTube livestream UI is pretty \ud83d\udca9 \n\nFactor in GME\u2019s interest of expanding into eSports, it would be more profitable in the long run for them if they owned their own streaming platform and not have to share profits with Twitch or YouTube. This would also be cheaper than a game Dev studio, which I\u2019ve seen a lot of people mention (those have massive overhead and limited to profits once every 3 years or so, and no one wants to compete with Fortnite)\nTo pile on, there\u2019s some major streamers out there that currently cannot stream together on air and there\u2019s no alternative platforms on the market to entertain you retards on. For those that don\u2019t know, Twitch won\u2019t let partners stream with other members that were banned, forcing exiled streamers to YouTube with zero alternative. This forces streamers/entertainers into a corner and it sucks to be cornered without any options. These 2 streaming services hold too much power over their talent and it reminds me a lot of our showdown with WallStreet fuckheads like Melvin, Steven Cohen, and Citron. \nAnd let\u2019s face it, I dunno about you but I really want to see Dr.D and TimmyTheTatman playing with each other on stream again because I miss those two playing together. Also YouTube livestream player is hot garbage and remains a total afterthought because Google knows Streamers have no alternatives, effectively cornering the market. \n\nI l believe a platform like this would totally justify the current share price as well! \nGME to the moon!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nPositions: 740 Shares of GME\n\nTL;DR if GME created a gaming livestream platform they could leverage it for their eSports scene and it would let TimmyTheTatman and Dr.Disrespect play together on stream again.",

Known as a \u201cgamma squeeze,\u201d this occurs when the sellers of the call options, in order to hedge their positions, buy the underlying stock. As the price of the stock rises, they need to buy more to maintain their hedge, creating the feedback loop.\n\nRead the full article and the Original source below:\n\n[https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/25/gamma-squeeze-gamestop-round-2/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/25/gamma-squeeze-gamestop-round-2/)\n\nWe still have a long way to go autists,  We have been given second chance so keep  god-damn \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's Take this Baby to the moon  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80",

        "title": "138% sHoRT fLoAt! Why it's wrong (and right) to compare GameStop to Volkswagen",
        "text": "Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nI've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.\n\nFirst, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from \u20ac348 to over \u20ac1K in the single day that it squeezed.\n\nAs for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).\n\nInstitutional Certified Diamond Handers\n\n|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|\n|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|\n|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|\n|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|\n|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|\n|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|\n|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|\n|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|\n|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|\n|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|\n|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|\n|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|\n|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|\n|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|\n|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|\n|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|\n\nOutstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!\n\nAgain, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \\~$120 from this scenario.\n\nPositions: 365 shares",

I don't like the current stock manipulation and I think Wall Street made a bad decision.  Conspiracies aside what is good about GameStop?  Not to long ago you could see trending stories about how GameStop has the worst business model, customer support, and trade in prices.  I myself rarely bought anything from GameStop because it was never convenient.  It was like going to a car salesman which I now do online too. PC games for the most part were always sold online.  I remember as soon as consoles caught up to online downloads I never bought a physical game again.  GameStop's atmosphere always sucked and looked like a dated museum.  I much rather of gone into BestBuy or Target.  GameStop is also a pawn shop model with games and gimmick collector toys.  eBay & Amazon already dominate this used market.  People want to buy new things and the used market has been established for a long time.\n\nWhat is positive about GameStop?  The pre-order line waits and the memories having to wait for Halo or Gears of War.  That is an archaic thing that no one longer does.  Pre-orders can be placed from the comfort of a home and the download queued.\n\nGameStop recently hired a eCommerce CEO.  The only thing that can keep GameStop going at this point is consumer loyalty.  No one is buying from GameStop.  All of the GME shareholders do not buy games from GameStop and will not.  Shareholders are obsessed with hording money and making money.\n\nSo after Wall Street short sellers are beaten, I believe GME will become a worthless piece of trash.\n\nEdit: Also another note I think WSB will just become Wall Street after this.  Once the money transfers all the crooked shady ruthlessness' will continue online on chat forums like this one.",

        "text": "As you all know Ryan Cohen owns a whopping 13% stake(probably more by now) in a \"dying/brick-and-mortar/blockbuster\" GameStop. \n\nLet's be honest, when was the last time you've been to GameStop to buy games? Most games are now online, ready to be played with just a touch of a button. However, I think Ryan sees an opportunity even in these troubled times for this physical retail company. \n\nBefore we even start guessing what Ryan is gonna do, we need to know what he has done that made him a billionaire.\n\nNamely, Chewy. Chewy was successful because of three things.\n\n1. He was how fragmented the pet food industry was.\n2. He was able to build an understanding relationship with Chewy's customers\n3. Top-of-the-line customer service\n\nThere are more points obviously but I know you retards all have short attention span so I'm going to keep it as short as possible. So if you look at those three points you should already be making connections with the gaming industry.\n\n1. Gaming industry is as fragmented as it could be. (Amazon,walmart, Bestbuy, target, etc. or EA play, ubisoft plus, PSN plus, etc.)\n2. The stores mentioned above are not \"gaming-oriented\" stores.\n3. Gamer specific customer service is almost non-existent or it's not really a thing.\n\nI believe Ryan saw this opportunity because it closely resembles his first company model. I'm not 100% sure what he'd do going forward but the gaming industry is booming right now because of covid and with the new consoles coming out now. This is probably the best time to snatch on this opportunity and tap into unlimited potential of gaining millions of gamers in US. \n\nI'd be excited to see a gaming platform on either computer or on consoles that unites all games under a single platform with a monthly subscription that is unbeatable compared to other services. \n\nSure it'll take months if not years but if this is the way that GameStop is going, I'd feel pretty safe with my positions.",

        "text": "&#x200B;\n\n* **GameStop** Volatility is picking up\n* **\u201cMeme Stock\u201d** phenomenon is not going away\n* **Success in GME** could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system\n* **Instant clearing** will not occur quickly\n* **Regulators** will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault\n\nAfter a few weeks of \u201cnormal\u201d 20%-30% intraday moves GameStop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterday\u2019s regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168.\n\n#### Volatility is picking up\n\nThe volume in after hours alone\u00a0 surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41M shares changing hands. It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.\n\nThe fact that GME\u2019s volume could approach the volume of AAPL \u2013 a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent \u201cmeme stock\u201d which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.\n\n#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes\n\nThe GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.\u00a0\n\nWhile this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We\u2019ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.\n\n#### Regulators Will Need to Step In\n\nWe have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven\u2019t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if \u201cmeme trading\u201d is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions \u2013 a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday\u2019s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions \u2013 a much larger and more important business \u2013 is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a \u201cbrownout\u201d event \u2013 much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.\n\nThe events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.\n\n#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play\n\nAt this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current\u00a0 versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows.\u00a0\n\nIf a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.\n\n#### Anathema to Free Markets\n\nThis is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.\n\nThe current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.\u00a0\n\n[www.60secondinvestor.com](https://www.60secondinvestor.com)",

        "title": "Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.",
        "text": "As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.\n\nAMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.\n\n****This is where we come in.****\n\nThe recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.\n\n>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.\n\n>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.\n\n>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.\n\n>It\u2019s been a wild ride for the nation\u2019s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.\n\nNow, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. \n\nThis movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. \n\nAnd the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.\n\nThis is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",

COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I\u2019d give it until the end of the year.\n\n2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.\n\n3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.\n\n4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.\n\n5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**\n\n6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.\n\n7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.\n\n8.) It\u2019s extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there\u2019s a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.\n\n9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.\n\n10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. \"Bankruptcy is off the table for now.\"**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.\n\n11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.\n\n12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)\n\n13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you\u2019re only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.\n\n14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let\u2019s keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).\n\n15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)\n\n*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*\n\n16.) Without AMC there\u2019s no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.\n\n17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.\n\n18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.\n\n19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)\n\n20.) **STONCCS only go up.**\n\n21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.\n\n# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Buy AMC.

        "text": "People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.\n\nSort by VOLUME\n\n$GME  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)  \n29,097 contracts @ $800  \n10,905 contracts @ $200  \n10,418 contracts @ $150\n\nThis is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.\n\n$BB  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)  \n6,665 contracts @ $11  \n2,483 contracts @ $12  \n1,692 contracts @ $10.50\n\n$AMC  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc)  \n43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!  \n27,299 contracts @ $9  \n26,471 contracts @ $10\n\nThey can't let the price above $8!\n\n$NOK  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok)  \n4,064 contracts $4  \n3,417 contracts $4.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:  \n**AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**  \n**NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**  \n**GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**  \n**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**\n\nOption holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.\n\nThis does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).\n\nIt is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.\n\nThere is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.\n\nAMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.\n\nBB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.\n\nNOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.\n\nCatalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).\n\nEveryone have a great weekend.\n\nDisclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: fucked formatting",

        "text": "I'm just going to get straight into it because there are too much bullshit surrounding this stock already. AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.\n\n\\- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E)\n\nAnd they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**\n\n[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd **shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!** :\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602)\n\nAnd more than **100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued**, they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:\n\n[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** \n\n**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**\n\n\\----------\n\nThis is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.\n\nIf you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.\n\n\\---------\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**\n\nPoistions:\n\nPut spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.\n\n\\-------",

The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.\n\nAMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.\n\nGME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63.

In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**A look at their** [**10-Q**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)\n\nLet\u2019s start with a look at their financial standing as of the end of September 2020. Obviously, a lot of things have happened since then and we\u2019ll get to that later, but let\u2019s first take a look at what their latest available financial position was to see how bad it was getting. Going through their 10-Q, here\u2019s some of their Q3 highlights\n\n* Income Statement\n   * Revenue - 120M (-85% YoY)\n   * Operating Expenses - 795M (-39% YoY)\n   * Net Loss - 906M\n* Balance Sheet\n   * Cash & Equivalents - 418M\n   * Current Assets - 609M\n   * Total Assets - 10.9B\n   * Current Liabilities - 1.59B\n   * Total Liabilities - 13.2B\n   * Total Equity (Deficit)  - (2.3B) deficit vs 1.2B equity in Q3 2019\n* Cash Flows\n   * Operations - (772M)\n   * Investing - (155M)\n   * Financing - 1.08B\n      * Raised over 1B cash from senior bond issuances\n   * Net Cash Increase - 153M\n* Notes & Forward Guidance\n   * Refinanced 87% of outstanding bonds for bonds due 2026 for higher-interest bonds w/ a principal reduction of 555M\n   * Lenders have given relief from maintenance covenants in their bonds temporarily. Will need to increase cash flow or EBITDA back to a sufficient level by the end of March, when the relief ends, to be in compliance with the covenants or else the bondholders can make the bonds payable / due immediately, unless lenders agree to extend it\n   * Cash burn = 388M during Q3\n   * Expects rent to be drastically increased starting in 2021 due to expiration of rent deferrals\n   * 600M in convertible debt to Silver Lake\n   * (335M) EBITDA in Q3\n   * **Expected to run out of cash by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, will require a sudden source of liquidity or increase in theatre attendance to not go bankrupt.**\n\n**Recent Events**\n\nThe last point can basically sum up the important part of the 10-Q; that they\u2019ve basically exhausted all possible sources of liquidity, and they would have most likely gone bankrupt some time early in 2021. They have a massive net deficit of 2.3B, which means that it would have been extremely likely that the shareholders would have been left with nothing in the case of bankruptcy. Even if their liquidity issues weren\u2019t going to immediately force them to bankruptcy, their inability to meet their debt covenants when they expire at the end of March would have likely put them in default if lenders gave up hope and started cutting their losses.\n\nAll of this meant that literally every hedge fund analyst looking at this would have recommended their fund go short on AMC, since it seemed obvious that they were about to go bankrupt - the management even stated this in their most recent financial statements; this is why AMC ended up with a 39M / 57M of the float short (69% SI) at the end of 2020 - it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and AMC bottomed out at $1.91 when all seemed lost and the intrinsic value of the stock was $0 in every analyst\u2019s mind.\n\nExcept, [as I\u2019ve learned last year the hard way](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h945ly/dddd_retail_investors_bankruptcies_dark_pools_and/), even if all the fundamentals and financials point to an obvious bankruptcy is coming in the near term, it\u2019s been a weird year and anything can happen. Specifically\n\n1. [Silver Lake converted all of their $600M of debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) to 44M shares during the AMC spike\n2. It raised $917M in cash from debt and equity (165M shares issued)\n\nAssuming the cash burn remained the same levels as Q3, which is the worst case scenario as states are much more likely to relax restrictions this year with vaccinations rolling out, this cash should last them all the way into Q4 2021. This also makes it much more likely that debt holders would extend their debt covenant waiver now that imminent bankruptcy is off the table. r/wallstreetbets **had effectively saved AMC from bankruptcy**.\n\n**AMC Today**\n\nWith this background, there\u2019s two mispricings that lends itself to a high-probability play.\n\n1. As of Feb 12, AMC was at $5.59, which is barely double the share price of it back when they seemed to be approaching near-certain imminent bankruptcy in a few weeks\n2. The Implied Volatility of put options are still extremely high based on the recent price action\n\nHere\u2019s some examples of the prices and IV of put options for AMC\n\n[Feb 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/wkm8nscusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bc0f459ac9d0a5c14587fe72733c727934c5c1)\n\n[Mar 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/winpkfjusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cec5b9b71d92e5b16fbf06570e95ed833750d45a)\n\n[Apr 16 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/pw5u741vsuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=712f8acdd7583d58db9f2de5478f3b42a0a9baff)\n\nFurthermore, [as of 1/29 data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC), there\u2019s still 38M shares short, meaning that not that many funds that were actually shorting AMC actually covered yet. Of course, because AMC was printing new shares like they\u2019re JPowell to print themselves out of bankruptcy, the short interest went down to 15% of float, meaning it\u2019ll be very unlikely to see another short squeeze.\n\n**Thesis**\n\n1. The stock is fundamentally undervalued at a market cap of $1.9B and share value of $5.50 (based on historical pricing; anyone doing an actual DCF analysis would say the equity is worth negative dollars because debt > EV). They were last at this price in late September, when there was uncertainty of their ability to survive another wave of lockdowns, and was $4.50 at late November, literally a month before they stated in their 10Q that they\u2019ve already released that they would run out of cash and go bankrupt. Compared to this, it makes no sense for this stock to still be at $5.50 now that it\u2019s extremely likely that AMC will not go bankrupt.\n2. The Implied Volatility on the put side is insanely high, especially if you consider that AMC is likely undervalued, and hedge funds probably aren\u2019t going to be adding additional shorts of AMC at this price, especially after seeing what happened to it a few weeks ago.\n\n**The Play**\n\nTo take advantage of the mispricings, I\u2019ve been short (i.e. write / sold) cash-covered puts on AMC on $5 and $6 strike prices for Feb, Mar, and Apr expiries since last week. Theta decay and a decreasing IV has caused the prices of these puts to go down substantially, but imo they\u2019re still ridiculously overpriced. For example, to lose money on selling $5.50 puts expiring in a few days, AMC will need to go down to $5.15 (almost 10%). For March and April ATM puts, AMC would need to go below $4.50 to lose money, which is below the share price of AMC when bankruptcy was imminent. And if AMC stays above $5.50 by that time, you\u2019d be making a healthy 21% return in 1 month.",

I try to post good information so everyone can make money and my previous posts has helped many.  Hope this helps you too.\n\n-  This is a real recovery play.  Look at IMAX as the perfect example.  They have a big market share in China, and China being first out of lockdown (still some partial lockdown in different cities), is recovering and everyone want to go out and watch movies.  That is why IMAX killed their earnings.  This will happen in the US as well, 100%.  New York partially opened their theatres, and this will continue across the board.  It is just a matter of time.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/11/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-imax-ceo-on-the-movie-industry-amid-covid.html\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005894/en/AMC-Theatres-Statement-on-the-Reopening-of-Movie-Theatres-in-New-York-City\n\n- **Very Important**  They will not go into bankruptcy.  This is the key factor here.  They just raised another 917 million, so bankruptcy is completely out of the question.  This in itself is already very bullish, as you don't have to wake up one morning and find your company filing for chapter 11.  Yes, they won't be able to restructure their debt, BUT, it is much easier for them to raise cash and your shares won't turn into fairy dust.  \n\nhttps://torontosun.com/business/money-news/u-s-theatre-chain-amc-says-bankruptcy-talk-is-completely-off-the-table\n\n-  There is a lot of interest from the retail public/publicity on this stock from the whole saga a month ago.  \n\n- look at the options chain, there are a lot of interest further out so there are a lot of bullish investors.   Since there is an dilution of 3x the outstanding shares to avoid bankruptcy, everyone should note at $10/share today it is already at it's ATH.  So play your options carefully.  But then again, valuation multiples are much higher today than it was before.  Don't play with money you can't afford to lose please.\n\n- Potential buy out from big boys (doubt it, not at this price but who knows lol)\n\nNOTE: They have earnings in two days.  Feb 25.  It will probably beat estimate but honestly no one knows.  If you want to be safe, maybe wait for the dip on earnings report and buy in after the report and before the earnings call?  Because earnings call will for sure be super bullish from management.  You can buy the gap.\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4\n\nGuys get in early, even though it went up quite a bit already.  \nI hope this helps everyone and good luck.\nPlease like this so it stays on top and everyone can see this.\n\n**Edit** If you are risk averse and Canadian, you can buy CGX Cineplex, I am in that as well.",

You may be thinking what about GameStop, well you're just a f****** autistic child living in his mother's basement... forget about GameStop, that squeeze was \"squoze\".\n\nThis is why AMC is going to be the next best thing since sliced bread:\nAll of the other movie theater companies had already filed for bankruptcy. This leaves AMC Theatres as The Last Man Standing. They just raised over $700M in additional funding which clears them of any short-term bankruptcies up coming \ud83e\udd11\n\nThere is an enormous amount of pent-up demand for entertainments especially Sports and movies. Where is everyone going to go once things go back to normal? They're going to go to the only place left in town and that's AMC \ud83c\udfda\ud83c\udfda\ud83c\udfe0\n\nWell you may be thinking \"This stock was $3 a month ago why should I buy it at $7?\"\nBecause \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c autists are holding those bags up baby, just buy now or cry later. \n\nAMC is seen as a value stock versus Gamestop considering the inflated valuations. Dollar for dollar youre better off buying the cheaper of the two, for unit bias and also because...\n\nWhat you can do with your shares while waiting:\n1) *Write covered calls for every 100 shares you own*- Implied Volatility is something most of you cant even spell so don't worry about what it means, it just means $$$ when writing calls.\n2) Make dinner for your wife's boyfriend.

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -  Jason Mudrick\u2019s hedge fund reaped almost $200 million on its stakes in firms that skyrocketed during a Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Mudrick Capital Management earned 9.8% in January, one of\nits best months ever, making the bulk of its gains on debt and equity options of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The firm also profited from the volatility in shares of GameStop Corp.\nThe $3.1 billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said.

        "text": "Listen retards, Im not a bot or some kind of manipulator. Just a simple fella, running his YouTube business in Germany and trying to make tendies so I can kick out the boyfriend of my wife.\n\nBrothers someday we will dine in Valhalla but for now we are in war. This war is not about the tendies, its not about the boyfriend of your wife. Its about justice.\n\nI keep seeing how GME and AMC are being treated as opponents. This is not true! I was honored to be serving along with you in the GME battle and it is almost won. We fought bravely and soon we will see victory. That means HOLD to your GME as if your life depends on it, you know why? Because it does (this is not financial advice).\n\nBut Im also serving on the frontlines with the other autists, your brothers, fighting hard with moneydriven cold shortsellers in the battle for AMC. Yesterday aftermarket we experienced a new short attack, just like we know from GME already as you can see here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC)\n\nBut for those who are not aware of AMC and its potentials, a short DD my fellow retards:\n\n1. AMC was trading at around $ 10 before the pandemic. Its all time high was 2017 at around 35$. Currently (after already 300% rise in the past 3 days) it is going to trade when the market opens at around 15$.\n2. AMC is pushing new revenue highs every year (except for 2020). 2012 the revenue was $2.5 Billion and 2019 they were at $5.4 Billion. ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/revenue))\n3. Their business model is legit: I got my first handjob while watching Spiderman 3.\n4. 2021 will be a huge year for blockbusters, just a name a few: The King's Man (March 12, 2021), Godzilla vs Kong (March 26, 2021), Mortal Kombat (April 16, 2021), Black Widow (May 7, 2021), Samaritan (June 4, 2021), Top Gun: Maverick (July 2, 2021), Minions: The Rise of Gru (July 2, 2021), Cinderella (July 16, 2021), The Suicide Squad (Aug. 6, 2021), No Time to Die (Oct. 8, 2021). [https://www.cnet.com/news/new-movies-coming-out-in-2021-marvel-james-bond-and-more-in-a-blockbuster-year/](https://www.cnet.com/news/new-movies-coming-out-in-2021-marvel-james-bond-and-more-in-a-blockbuster-year/)\n5. Amazon and AMC were talking about potential cooperations (Amazon Prime Members can go to the theatre for free). Netflix could try the same. Movies ARE dope but watching MOVIES in a theatre is even MORE DOPE. Netflix and Amazon know that! Since they are the new hollywood, soon its going to be war over who is controlling the movie theatres.\n6. Adam Aron the CEO of AMC is jewish and went to Harvard.\n\nBut now lets talk about why AMC is really worth talking about. **It is right now the 3rd most shorted stock after GME and Virgin.** [**https://www.highshortinterest.com/**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)\n\nIts not like GME, that is right! GME has short interest high as 138% where AMC has only 69%. BUT: AMC shortsellers are also DOUBLING DOWN. Pretty soon we can see short interest higher than 100% in AMC. Again this is not financial advice, just a retard writing this while the bf of my wife is out for a walk.\n\nWhat Im saying is brothers: Lets win the fight over GME but do not forget the AMC autists. We can win the battle but lose the war. Do not let this happen, lets win this fucking war. Valhalla is waiting for us but first we have to finish what we came for. Not the money, not the glory, we came for blood.\n\nP.S.: I like the stock and STONKS only go up. This is not financial advice so do your own DD.",

And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.\n\nFor the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but they\u2019ve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.\n\nBecause when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.\n\nIn fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**\n\nHere is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.\n\n# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup\n\nChances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.\n\nAll of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if they\u2019re as bad as analysts claim.\n\n# II. A Discussion on Debt\n\nMedia outlets keep honing in on this debt like it\u2019s an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.\n\nWe can categorize the money used into four parts:\n\n* **New equipment and amenities**\n* **Lease payments**\n* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**\n* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**\n\nPay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its \"new locations\" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.\n\nOn the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopen\u2014and AMC is back at full operation\u2014what will it look like?\n\n# III. The Future of AMC\n\nThere's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.\n\n*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*\n\nWhy would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the \"cinema experience\". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical \"people'', instead let's talk about research studies.\n\nIn a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.\n\n*\"But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?\"*\n\nIt's not what streaming \"gets out of this\" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.\n\nNow besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didn\u2019t just change their amenities.\n\nThey had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?\n\n# IV. Valuation\n\nFirst, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:\n\n[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**\n\n[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion\n\n[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion\n\n[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion\n\n[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion\n\nIn the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.\n\nAnd, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).\n\nClueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.\n\nNow I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.\n\n**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.\n\nIf you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only \"not too late\", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.\n\nHow high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?\n\nSo when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):\n\n***\"Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it.\"***\n\nIn our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now I\u2019m no expert and can\u2019t tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.\n\nWith so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.\n\nAt the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**\n\n*Will there be people that disagree with this?*\n\n*Sure.*\n\nWill people continue to short AMC as it goes up?\n\n*Absolutely.*\n\nDo I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?\n\n*Really? See section III.*\n\nBut institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).\n\n*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered\u2026  with AMC $600m less in debt.*\n\nWe all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.\n\n# V. Conclusion - Resurgence\n\nWe are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.\n\nWhat you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so low\u2014while still holding such great fundamental prospects\u2014 its share price is ready to blow up.\n\nIn the future when \u201cThe Deep Squeeze\u201d is turned into a movie, we\u2019ll be a part of history.\n\nAnd you\u2019re going to want to see it on the big screen.\n\n\\--\n\nPosition: $50k in calls and shares\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO $69.69\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80$AMC TO THE MOON\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*",

Right now for the reason of the movement, but here is another major reason why I know it, and other theaters will blow.\n\nThink about it, the future of workmanship, UBI, AI taking over jobs, it will pressure society to rethink what it means to live and enjoy life in the next 10 years.\n\nWhat does one do if they have free money, no work, and the desire to do SOMETHING?\n\nThey do one (or more) of 3 major things:\n\n- They learn / explore\n- They socialize / connect\n- They have fun / seek entertainment\n\nAMC is step 3 of this societal change, but most importantly, step 2 as well. It resolves the human desire to both socialize and be entertained.\n\nThat is why I am convinced things like digital/physical entertainment will blow up like mad. It seems trivial, but old school physical theatres are going to be huge as we go back to our roots. There is also a massive opportunity in VR as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on entertainment stocks outside of this movement?\n\nEdit: To add, I think this interest for physical entertainment will never die down as humanity advances because once we peak in terms of mobile / VR technology, we will be far more intrigued to go back to our roots. Its for this reason that physical sports will never die. The reason athletes arent just hopping on digital hockey, soccer, football etc.",

        "text": "Lots of posts here lately discussing the future (or lack thereof) of AMC Entertainment Holdings.  For a quick DD, let's compare their stats pre-pandemic and today:\n\n**Pre-pandemic:** in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $1.3B.\n\n**Now:** in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $2.5/share, and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $0.12B.\n\nTheir revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments), ***they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution***, assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.\n\nDisclaimers: This is not financial advice.

        "title": "Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director",
        "text": "\\*Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.   \nI work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. \n\nBut recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.\n\n**Quick Facts:**  \n1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   \n2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  \n**And here's the banger:**  \n3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. \n\nThis is bad for the studies because their \"great\" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. \n\n**Pent-Up Demand:**  \nBox office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). \n\nWhen Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. \n\nIf the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers \n\n**Another possibility:**  \nIf Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. \n\nTL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.",

        "text": "$GME featured later in the post, too. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash. Trust me. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\u200b\nI will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \\~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.\n\u200b\nLet's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:\n\u200b\n* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M\n* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B\n\u200b\n\nWhen seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.\n\u200b\n\nThe main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.\n\u200b\n\nAs we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).\n\u200b\n\nAt the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.\n\u200b\n\nThe confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\n**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**\n\u200b\n\n* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide\n   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. \n      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.\n   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.\n   * They will all be packed when opened back up.\n      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.\n   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.\n\u200b\n\n**The shifting sentiment from \"Netflix and Chill\" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**\n\u200b\n\n* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [71% of consumers want to go to the fucking theaters](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.\n* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. \n* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.\n   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \\[Samuel L. Jackson voice\\] \"Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?\"\n* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.\n* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.\n\u200b\n\n**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   \n\nEveryone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  \n\u200b\n\u200b\n* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!\n* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.\n   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \\*\n* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.\n   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. \n   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc. \n\n\u200b\n**Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.**\n\nIn doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. \n\n\u200b\n*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares\n\n\n*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares\n\n\u200b\n*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million \n\n\u200b\nOn the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. \n\u200b\n\n\nRegardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . \n\n\u200b\nIn closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. \n\u200b\nAlso as with $GME, I like the stock.\n\n\u200b\n*Positions*\n\n\u200b\nshares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while\n\n\u200b\noptions: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOn WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.\n\u200b\n\nEdit: I will set a limit order of 100 to expire in 90 days, the brokerage cannot sell my shares. If I still don\u2019t want to sell at that price and it gets close, just add another $100. I will never sell, but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value. \n\n\n\\[\\*\\] I know Netflix has a Los Angeles office you jackass. A lot of their content still sucks. It's just a fucking fact.",

        "text": "I may get hate for this post but please, just read and then curse me out if you like, but I\u2019m just thinking of an idea HOW TO BEAT HF at their own game. \n\n\nShort Interest data from Marketbeat.com\n\nGAMESTOP (NYSE:GME) SHORT INTEREST DATA\nCurrent Short Volume:\t61,780,000 shares\nPrevious Short Volume:\t71,200,000 shares\nOutstanding Shares:\t102,270,000 shares\n\n\nAMC ENTERTAINMENT \nCurrent Short Volume:\t44,670,000 shares\nPrevious Short Volume:\t38,990,000 shares\nOutstanding Shares:\t52,070,000 shares\n\nAt the current price of GME $60 vs AMC $7. JUST ROUNDING You could get about 10 shares of AMC vs 1 share of GME. With the amount of WSB and Stocktwits and interest around the world, I believe is possible for retail to buy and take possessions of all these AMC shares rather than institutional owners. \n\nI know wallstreet is crying calling us cheaters but we are not colluding. We just noticed how they opened themselves up by being greedy and are just using the fundamentals of shorting to our advantage. Their greediness and irresponsible of shorting these stocks is what\u2019s causing high volatility and spikes. So it\u2019s THEIR OWN FAULT the stock has potential to SPIKE UP. \n\nWhat Wallstreet is doing is ILLEGAL and MANIPULATION. what we are doing is taking information available to the public and using it to our favor. For example, let\u2019s pretend A Professional boxer (HF) vs a rookie boxer (us). Odds are that is very likely the professional boxer wins. HOWEVER, the rookie fighter learns the professional boxer just became blind on his right eye (OVERSHORTING SHARES). The rookie boxer uses that information to his advantage to attack the pro boxer from the right side, giving the rookie and advantage. THIS IS ALL LEGAL! Now come the referee (WALLSTREET) and notices the to pro boxer(HF) is about to lose. So the referee begins adding extra rounds, adding rest time, telling the judges to not add points to the ROOKIE boxers. ALL ILLEGAL STUFF to make the PRO win. THATS WHAT WE ARE FACING!!!! \n\nTherefore, I believe if we all focus on AMC, that has less outstanding shares and is about 10 times cheaper than GME, we can \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\n\nFor those asking me to disclose my positions. I had BB, GME, NOK and AMC. Now I sold everything and decided to bet for  AMC because Blackrock just disclosed having a 6% ownership and the barstool guy also bought about 700K into AMC",

(\u201cWanda\u201d) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cClass B common stock\u201d) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), into an equal number of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cClass A common stock\u201d), pursuant to the terms of the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.\n \nThe conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.\n \nThe conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:\n \nVoting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.\n \nEconomic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  \n \nCapitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n \n\n\ud83d\ude80",

(EXPR). whose shares were up 250%.\n\nWhat is your opinion? What do you guys think?",

This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.\n\n(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)\n\nI went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.\n\n[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)\n\nShares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).\n\nBack in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).\n\nI wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.\n\n# GameStop\n\nThe first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.\n\n[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)\n\nBut things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.\n\nInvestors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.\n\n[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)\n\nFinally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (\"It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!\"), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!\n\nAt its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.\n\n# AMC Entertainment\n\nTo understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.\n\n[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)\n\n[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)\n\nWhat coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.\n\nThe second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...\n\nAnd then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.\n\nAlso like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.\n\nWhere does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.\n\n**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**\n\nPositions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)\n\nIf anyone wants to play around with the code or data I used to generate the first plot (monthly normalized failure to deliver data), [I put it on GitHub](https://github.com/bobsomers/evidence_of_naked_short_fraud_in_gme_and_amc).",

        "text": "\u201cTrading Update for GME & AMC\nHi,\n\nFrom today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.\n\nWhat does this mean for me?\nYou can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday\u2019s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.\n\nNone of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.\n\nFor customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you\u2019re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you\u2019ll be able to see them in the app.\n\nWhy is this happening?\nWhen a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.\n\nThe required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security\u2019s holdings on broker\u2019s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth\u2019s clearing partners.\n\nThis increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.\n\nWhen will they be available again to buy?\nThis is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.\n\nTeam Revolut\u201d\n\n\nHOLD\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "text": "# This is directly coppied from Degiro.\n\nBy Svea Herbst-Bayliss\n\nBOSTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Prominent hedge funds including Dan Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners and Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management chalked up deep losses last month as hotly traded Gamestop hurt returns while others like Jason Mudrick's Mudrick Capital posted gains during January's turbulent trading, investors in the funds said on Tuesday.\n\nThe bulk of January's hedge fund returns were influenced by a late-month rally in unloved stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment. The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended January down 1.1%, with the vaccine rollout and stimulus plans a large focus for the month.\n\nMelvin Capital, one of the biggest funds betting on a drop in GameStop's share price lost 53% in January when the stock price was forced higher by an army of retail investors using the Robinhood online trading app.\n\nOther funds like Point72, which invests with Melvin Capital, lost nearly 9% and D1 tumbled 20% while Maplelane, which was also short GameStop, lost 45%, people familiar with the returns said. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital lost 11%.\n\nCitadel lost 3%, a person familiar with the returns said on Sunday. Balyasny Asset Management, was down 0.5%, an investor in the fund said.\n\nWilliam Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings, which holds only a handful of stocks and does not traditionally bet that stock prices will drop by shorting, lost 1.3% in January as many stocks sold off amid the trading turbulence.\n\nBut there were winners too. Mudrick Capital, seen as a hero to the retail crowd for having rescued AMC Entertainment with clever financing - the firm is not a short seller - posted its best month ever with a 9.8% gain after a 11.2% gain in 2020, a person familiar with the returns said.\n\nDinakar Singh's Axon Capital, which bet last year that a vaccine would soon boost travel, posted an 8.5% gain in January and is up another 8% in the first two days of February, a person familiar with the returns said.\n\nAnd Tiger Global Management which last year earned $10.4 billion, started 2021 with a 1% gain in January.\n\nRepresentatives for the funds either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Megan Davies and Andrea Ricci)\n\n(([svea.herbst@thomsonreuters.com](mailto:svea.herbst@thomsonreuters.com); +617 856 4331; Reuters Messaging: [svea.herbst.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net](mailto:svea.herbst.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)))",

        "text": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday-\n\n*****\n\n# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November\n\n> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday\u2019s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average\u2019s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow\u2019s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday\u2019s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer\u2019s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday\u2019s premarket trading.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year\n\n> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week\n\n> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump\u2019s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d Trump\u2019s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine\n\n> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/EAt0w48.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CUFSI6k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/58WpS5d.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/ouc42oI.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/alaiab8.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/GYP6644.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hRzLA06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8wWPOOE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xCQGHw3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/S1k039c.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/oHk2NFH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/iscvKxs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-hasbro-energizer-palantir-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Hasbro (HAS)** \u2013 Hasbro reported quarterly profit of $1.27 per share, 13 cents a share above estimates.

Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-29-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street\u2019s volatile week continues\n\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday\u2019s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.\n\n> The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday\u2019s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks \u2014 Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron \u2014 reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants\n\n> J&J\u2019s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial\u2019s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna\u2019s, both of which are two doses.\n\n> U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday\u2019s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading\n\n> Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday\u2019s premarket, respectively.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure\n\n> Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/FAARPIg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3sV2GGG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/tHi3iJP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/b6nExyq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Hfq6e7l.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rSAUfwb.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UO3iJXe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tyEgAPB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/B8MdQcL.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/4GYL3Jo.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/vSBQ9GL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PyefIYU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/v5mmpPt.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-biogen-skyworks-solutions-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Biogen (BIIB)** \u2013 The drugmaker\u2019s shares jumped nearly 12% premarket on news that the Food and Drug Administration has extended the review period by three months for its experimental Alzheimer\u2019s treatment aducanumab.

        "text": "First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your \u201cHF shill\u201d comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (\u2026can\u2019t be sure with half you guys\u2026)\n\nThe perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it\u2019s so obvious it hurts. AMC\u2019s ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.\n\nThis is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.\n\n**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80\u00a0\n\n# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)\n\nOK\u2026 Why CNK? Simple: I ran a \u201cMoon Screen\u201d which looked for:\u00a0\n\n1. **High Short Interest** (>20% of floatable shares outstanding)\n2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn\u2019t Had A \u201cGME moment\u201d, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)\n3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)\n4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)\u00a0\n\nand CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it\u2019s because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That\u2019s right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it\u2019s similarity to GME pre-orbit.\u00a0\n\n# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)\n\nCOVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK\u2019s theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World\n\n* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)\n\nCinemark\u2019s theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don\u2019t take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): \u201c\\[CNK\\] tends to be more suburban, while \\[AMC\u2019s\\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.\u201d **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don\u2019t fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:\n\n1. Suburban locations have lower rent\n2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs\n\nJust think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be \u201cthe only game in town\u201d in suburbia\n\nIn addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark\u2019s customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:\n\n1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater\n\n# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather \u201cCOVID Storm\u201d\n\n* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID\n\nStrong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).\u00a0\n\nIndustry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% \u201cfatter\u201d (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)\n\nLow rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.\n\n# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness\n\n25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Valuation/\\*Nerd Shit\\*:**\n\n* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago\u00a0\n* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.\n* EBITDA was \\~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at\u00a0700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first \u201cnormal\u201d year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)\n\n**Target Price: $38.50**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Afterthought \u2013 Takeout Upside:**\n\n* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?\n* Just as restaurants won\u2019t go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second\n* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand\n* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes/Links:**\n\n**Sean Gamble** \\- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*\n\n>\"And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it's a limited overlap.\"\n\nCNK Breaks Higher After 20:\n\n* [https://stocknews.com/news/cnk-the-bullish-case-for-cinemark-holdings-cnk/](https://stocknews.com/news/cnk-the-bullish-case-for-cinemark-holdings-cnk/)\n\nTakeover Makes Sense Links:\n\n* [https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/amazon-amc-theatres-acquisition-buyout/](https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/amazon-amc-theatres-acquisition-buyout/)\n* [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-film-breakingviews-idUSKBN28W0YM](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-film-breakingviews-idUSKBN28W0YM)",

        "text": " \n\nFrom today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: **GME**) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: **AMC**) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  \n\n\n### What does this mean for me?\n\nYou can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday\u2019s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.\n\nNone of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  \n\n\nFor customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you\u2019re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you\u2019ll be able to see them in the app.\n\n### Why is this happening?\n\nWhen a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  \n\n\nThe required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security\u2019s holdings on broker\u2019s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth\u2019s clearing partners.  \n\n\nThis increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.\n\n### When will they be available again to buy?\n\nThis is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.  \n\n\nTeam Revolut\n\n**Capital at Risk**\n\nThe value of a stock may fall as well as rise and you may get back less than what you initially paid, and in some cases the stock may lose its entire value and you may lose your initial investment. This is not investment advice. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision.  \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** Revolut Trading Ltd. is an appointed representative of Resolution Compliance Ltd which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN:574048).",

        "text": "&#x200B;\n\nPHOTO: carlo allegri/Reuters\n\nAMC\n\n56.20%\n\nGME\n\n62.98%\n\nHow Clearing Demands Helped Ground the WallStreetBets Stocks\n\nTelis Demos\n\n\u2022\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast Updated January 29, 2021, 6:33 PM\n\nWhen some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a clearinghouse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do they work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow does the financial crisis figure in this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as \"T+2\" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrite to Telis Demos at [telis.demos@wsj.com](mailto:telis.demos@wsj.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a9 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

In addition, I bet both my testes every morning when I wakeup that I will come onto wall street bets, and there will be some idiot down an egregious amount of capital screaming \u201cHOLD THE LINE\u201d. This was entertaining for the first 2 weeks. Now it is literally retarded. There is no \u201cline\u201d being held when you move from $500 to $70 in a week span. You are just a bag-holding mongoloid who has lost more money than you were ever prepared to lose. I need the old WSB back. I need more than 2 stocks being shilled constantly or I\u2019m going to have a sever aneurism and die. I might jump off a cliff if I see another tier 3 retard shilling AMC while he\u2019s down 98%. Please mods save this sub. My soul cannot take it. \n\nPS: if you are still holding AMC or GameStop you\u2019re an absolute idiot. Cry about it. Downvoting me won\u2019t save all the money you lost lmao. ApEz tOgeThEr StRoNg.\n\nPs part 2: if GameStop goes above 500$ I\u2019ll ban myself from this sub\n\nEdit 3: the newfags are very upset they invested capital and are now losing it. Very funny. Many triggered retards here.\n\nEdit 4: I have come to the conclusion every angry comment is bagholding hard. Very sad!\n\nEdit 5: lmao people raging in here like they thought GameStop was the next Tesla. I\u2019m dead hahah.",

        "text": "When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.\n\nThe second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. \"Smart\" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).\n\nThe next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.\n\nI loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say \"I just taught you a very valuable lesson.\" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells \"7 out!\" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.\n\nNow I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. \"Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k.\" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.\n\nEvery one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.\n\nThe people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are \"due\". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.\n\nThe people saying \"If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!\" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.\n\nTldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying \"tomorrow is the day.\" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.\n\nEdit: Screenshots from the worst 40 minutes of my financial life https://imgur.com/a/MlTRJmx\n\nEdit 2: JFC, some of you are takin WSB way too seriously. You should not be using reddit for DD. Also, this is not financial advice. Don't take financial advice from someone who tells you stories about chasing highs at casinos.\n\nEdit 3: This is WSB, my dudes. I'm glad most of you were entertained by my story.

        "text": " Message Subject: Unfair market manipulation  \nMessage Text:  \nHi, I am a concerned citizen (and military member) that is concerned over last couple of day's news in regards to brokerage firms restricting user's ability to place the trades they would like which currently includes companies like Gamestop, Blackberry and AMC Entertainment (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html). The brokerage firms Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers are the firms I am aware of that have restricted either sale or purchase of certain companies based on their perception of volatility and to \"mitigate risk to customers\". This is unacceptable in a free market. These companies have been pushed down to major lows based on short selling and manipulation. People who love these companies have banded together to stop the short selling and raise these stocks back to where we feel they belong and when these large, money rich firms got burned, all of a sudden the volatility is a problem. This is the very definition of market manipulation and I am asking that my representatives look into this and correct it. If the market is not truly free, as it has not been for many years, then only those with access to major wealth (much of which isn't even owned by these firms) will continue to trade in the market, and only these firms will be able to enrich themselves. Please look at this and take it seriously. I think that only legislative change can fix this injustice. \n\nVery respectfully, \n\nintellectually challenged individual.\n\nEveryone do their part....this movement needs to keep going!",

        "title": "Twinkies for Tendies: Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)",
        "text": "# TL;DR\n\n**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***\n\nTwinkies to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)\n\n# Intro\n\nSup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won\u2019t see a squeeze of GME\u2019s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call \u201casymmetric upside\u201d (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I\u2019ll describe below.\n\n**So what\u2019s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can\u2019t make this up)\u2026now they\u2019re going to make us some Tendies\u2122 as well.\n\nFor some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there\u2019s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.\n\nThe company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.\n\n**So what\u2019s the thesis?** We think there\u2019s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.\n\n# Technical Thesis\n\n1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** \u2013 Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we\u2019re aware of (can\u2019t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.\n2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** \u2013 Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you\u2019re looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.\n3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** \u2013 There\u2019s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.\n\n# Fundamental Thesis\n\n1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \\~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.\n2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \\~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing \u2013 and likely gaining share.\n3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***\n4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells cr\u00e8me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess\u2019 existing distribution footprint.\n5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company\u2019s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.\n\n# Potential Risks\n\n1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.\n2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \\~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \\~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \\~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \\~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.\n3. **Customer concentration.** The Company\u2019s largest customer is Walmart, which was \\~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \\~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don\u2019t think retail stores will do anything irrational.\n4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.\n\n# Appendix\n\n* **TWNK Q3'20 investor presentation**: [Q3'20 Investor Presentation (November 2020)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/2a95b8c5-1127-4d0c-867b-d9437adc9036)\n* TWNK acquisition of Voortman Cookies investor presentation: [Acquisition of Voortman Cookies (December 2019)](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/27c9ebfa-9448-4987-ae0f-b6b23c794ee6)\n* **Reference for TWNK short interest:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWNK/key-statistics?p=TWNK)\n* **Reference for AMC short interest of 10-15%:** [S3 Partners Tweet (1/29/21)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) and [AMC Short Interest Calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9cjuc/amc_short_interest_is_often_overstated_and/)\n* ***Disclaimer: I own a position in the Stock (TWNK); Warrants (TWNKW); August 20, 2021 $17.50 Call Options (TWNK210820C17.5); and August 20, 2021 $20.00 Call Options (TWNK210820C20)***\n* ***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes. Please conduct your own diligence. Past performance is not indicative of future results.***\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.\n\n***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***",
