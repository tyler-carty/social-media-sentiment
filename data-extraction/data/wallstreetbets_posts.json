Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: FUCK I ACCIDENTALLY POSTED THIS TOO EARLY - this is a glitch in my faulty time machine and I don't know how to amend, was scheduled to post this for July 2023.

If you can\u2019t stand to lose money, you shouldn\u2019t invest or you invested more than you were willing to lose.\n\nIf you\u2019re a real holder, you\u2019re waiting to see what happens. I hold 55 shares of GME at $224.\n\nEdit: Holy cow I\u2019m getting ripped apart in the comments lol. Yes the point is also to make money, and I\u2019m here out of principle.\n\nEdit 2: The main reason I bought so much is that I was so frustrated and upset by Citadel\u2019s and Robinhood\u2019s actions as well as those by other brokerages.

Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.\n\n\\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$\n\n\\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!\n\n\\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.\n\n\\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.\n\n\\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.\n\nPlease have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.\n\nTL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",

        "text": "**OK LISTEN UP**\n\nShorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. \"Like what?\" you may ask...\n\n1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)\n\n1. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price... \n\n a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). \n\n b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today\n\n1. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.\n\nThis is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.\n\ntldr; hold, buy more, whatever. Don't fall for their shit. GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "text": "Thought I would have a quick run through of the mid February 13F's to see who has the big positions against GME. Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.\n\nBiggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.\n\nIf you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.\n\nYou also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.\n\nIf you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.\n\nEdit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......\n\nLet me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idiots on TV might say we are turning the market into a casino, however we as shareholders are up against a company that has bluffing as a core part of its trading strategy and company culture.

What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?\n\nWe don\u2019t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don\u2019t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don\u2019t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children\u2019s college funds away just to post memes about it.\n\nYour plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven\u2019t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.\n\nDouble down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. \n\nTake all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.",

        "text": "Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month.\n\n**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)\n\nEDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO\n\n**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**...\n\n**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**\n\nHere is why my fellow tards,\n\n1. **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"**Lackluster day**\" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!\n2. **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **\"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.**\n3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.\n\nSOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v59kaj2xapk61.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=2530b261ce274a75e989677eb7eb32a7e5fad028\n\n**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)**\n\n4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.\n\n[F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/w55we4o6dpk61.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=e211a49e42220b19f3998f6c764a4dbd428c5bb0)\n\n5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:**\n\n\\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d\n\n\\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.\n\nthis shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[STILL F ROBINHOOD](https://preview.redd.it/q5m4zzdjepk61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=44bddf0d683a160630575ae539c13438fff57204)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.**\n\n**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a \"NEW SQUEEZE RKT\" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**\n\n**IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.**",

With that being said, NOT FUCKING EVERYTHING IS A PLOY BY HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU OUT OF GME. This rocket squeeze was created by CEO, the CEO of rocket has done amazing things with the company, and their balance sheet is impressive. He hates shorts as much as we do, so he decided to do something about it by essentially creating a gamma squeeze. Rocket was a really good play, especially with options. We don't need to discredit good plays just because they are not Gamestop.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all the awards",

        "text": "How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]\n\nRobinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.\n\nHere\u2019s a trick that ~~will work.~~\n\n**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **\n\n1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).\n2) Scroll all the way down the call list.\n3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).\n4) Immediately exercise.\n\nI just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.\n\nBest of luck out there! Let\u2019s get them!!!\n\nP.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can\u2019t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~\n\n_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.\n\n_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) This works for pretty much any stock.\n\n2) There\u2019s a catch. You need enough money (please don\u2019t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nExample:\n\n- $GME is $300\n- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000\n- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).\n- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)\n\nAfter exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",

So they're basically increasing the share volume and covering their earlier shorts without paying a dime so that it doesn't cause eF-T-D. They could technically do this infinitely unless maybe government regulations intervenes?\n\nIt doesn't matter if the price drops, just hold your shares, you don't need to buy, you need to HOLD OR PLACE A SELL ORDER FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU WANT TO SELL $1000+, $100,000+, whatever you want. The share price may drop (even if they continue doing ladder attacks) but the moment they start buying from the actual shareholders again, the price will rise extremely fast. If we all want to sell at $1000 then it will rise to $1000 immediately, it's just whatever an actual shareholder wants to sell at. And proof is in the pudding that majority only want to buy or hold.\n\nYOU CAN BUY OR NOT BUY. IT DOESN'T MATTER EITHER WAY, WE STILL CHOOSE OUR SELLING PRICE. If we stop buying then eF-T-D kicks in and they have to buy back shares at whatever price we want. If we keep buying then also that's good but just means it's a longer game and the pressure is going to be worse for them unless government or DTCC intervenes and forces them to close. Also worst case scenario for this whole thing is if hedgies do go bankrupt from this or Failure-To-Deliver and fined, then we still get our money from [clearing party](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/quadrillion-dollar-corporation-at-the-heart-of-the-financial-system-20150707-gi6w7b)/broker. Basically we are win/win, set your desired sell price.\n\n**TL;DR**: Ape stonk \ud83e\udda7\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c Shares are heavily shorted and increasing.

        "title": "GME Short Squeeze: Act II",
        "text": "Good day, fellow retards.  We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It\u2019s apparent by now that it\u2019s not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they\u2019re going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:\n\n\\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.\n\n\\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions\n\n\\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.\n\n\\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.\n\nMelvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it\u2019s very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they\u2019ve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.\n\nIf GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can we know this is likely true?:\n\n\\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering\n\n\\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above\n\n\\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.\n\n\\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they\u2019ll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn\u2019t cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it\u2019s costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nPositions: I own Shares\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a professional.

On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of \u201ethis is over\u201c, \u201ewe missed the squeeze\u201c, \u201eI am going to loose it all\u201c, \u201eentered at 320$ - I am doomed\u201c. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.\n\n**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**\n\nYou realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET \u2013 yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! \u2013 and follow DD posted by people with names like \u201eSHOW\\_ME\\_YOUR\\_ANAL\\_TITS\u201c? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry \u201eOne-Wish-comes-true\u201c show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn\u2019t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don\u2019t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments \u2013 this is about \u201eget rich or die trying!\u201c. This is not r/investing!\n\n**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**\n\nIf this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this \u201eSaudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts \u2013 but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now \u2013 could be though the next big thing \u2013 got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET \u2013 the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize \u2013 you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn\u2019t do if you like the system).\n\n**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? \ud83d\ude13**\n\nSo there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It\u2019s a fucking global movement now (or not \u2013 could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8eand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy \u2013 we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven\u2019t understand the concept or how this works \u2013 speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up \u2013 desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors \u2013 shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious \u2013 you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let\u2019s be fucking honest \u2013 most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody \u2013 I even don\u2019t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).\n\n**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**\n\nDeal with it \u2013 we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That\u2019s it. If we are right \u2013 this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock \u2013 do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought \u2013 hmmmm makes sense \u2013 I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \\[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don\u2019t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) \u2013 no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the \ud83d\ude80 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.\n\nSo please \u2013 no post without \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and if you want to fukn leave the party \u2013 leave \u2013 but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.\n\nP.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I\u2019d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  \u2013 I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e \n\nEdit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \\- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.\n\nEdit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\\_everyone\\_its\\_mark\\_cuban\\_jumping\\_on\\_to\\_do\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \\- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.\n\nEdit 3: Bought 5@103 \n\nEdit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)\n\nEdit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again.

        "text": "I\u2019ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I\u2019m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...\n\nTl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING\n\nTreat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn\u2019t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. \n\nLonger version:\n\nThere will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. \n\nGME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It\u2019s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn\u2019t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. \n\nGME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it\u2019s why we can do this. You don\u2019t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn\u2019t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won\u2019t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. \n\n\nRemember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don\u2019t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. \n\nI think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It\u2019s what hedge funds are doing. It\u2019s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. \n\nCash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don\u2019t look for a made up catalyst. It\u2019s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. \n\nI left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God\u2019s work (not religious just an expression). I\u2019ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). \n\nThis is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that\u2019s interpretation. \n\nI eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!\n\nI hope all newcomers see this...\n\nEdit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how \u201cGameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that\u2019s why shorties keep coming back to \u2018squeeze\u2019\u201d but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!\n\nWhenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name. I\u2019ll be there to put you back on the right path.",

        "text": " \n\n>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!\n\nWrong.\n\nNo one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\n>WHAT?!\n\nYou heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.\n\nThey don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a \"30 cent stock\" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.\n\nAll the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.\n\nI'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nSo let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:\n\n**# of Shares - Price**\n\nx 20 - $0.30c\n\nx 80 - $5\n\nx 400 - $20\n\nx 600 - $40\n\nx 900 - $60\n\nx 2,000 - $100\n\nx 5,000 - $150\n\nx 10,000 - $200\n\nx 30,000 - $300\n\nx 50,000 - $400\n\nx 150,000 - $500\n\nx 1 mil - $1,000\n\nx 15 mil - $5,000\n\nx 30 mil - $69,420\n\nGet it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.\n\nGet it?\n\n*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*\n\nThey need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.",

        "text": "Upcoming GME \u201cPossible\u201d Catalysts\n\nThere are some great Due Diligence posts out there regarding the short percentage on GME, the hiding of the shorts game with An ETF that cannot be named here and other ETF\u2019s, and the AI model of where GME could moon at because of this.  I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in.  They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have.  These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail.  The high frequency trading, the media, and the schill accounts.\n\nWe all know why we are here, duh it\u2019s cause \u201cwe like the stock\u201d. Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about.  Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb. We don\u2019t know exactly what will start the frenzy. What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it\u2019s no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies.  So here is a list of certain key items coming up.\n\n1.  This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday.  Then it really hit when u/deepfuckingvalue followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares.  Fucking legend.  That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday.  A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares.  This \u201cmight\u201d be all the catalyst we need to see the moon.\n\n2. An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio.  If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares.  Honestly we don\u2019t know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME.\n\n3. GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th.  This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush.  In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter.  We also don\u2019t know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction.\n\n4.  Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting.  In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming \u201cHard to Borrow\u201d with additional rates and fees to borrow them.  The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.  You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting.  With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different.  I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons.  The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party.\n\nLike I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events.  Like it is repeated over and over again we don\u2019t know when the squeeze will occur because we don\u2019t know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies. All we know is when it happens hold on.\n\nThank you for reading, hope you are all well informed.  Please do outside research and don\u2019t rely on any one person as this is not financial advice.  I\u2019m just a fellow ape holding GME that\u2019s eats the crayons my wife\u2019s boyfriend brings me when he comes over.  I prefer the orange crayons. I am not a cat. I like the stock. I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it\u2019s great information however I don\u2019t have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria.\n\nObligatory \n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1b\ud83c\udf1b\ud83c\udf1b",

        "title": "GME - EndGame part 6: The Big Reset, or The Greatest Financial Crime of the Century - and how to play GME going forward",
        "text": " \n\nThis is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I\u2019ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. \n\n**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don\u2019t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck \u201cdiamond handing\u201d, I\u2019m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I\u2019m trading GME. \n\n# Previous Important Posts\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous analysis.\n\n* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven\u2019t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close \n* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. \n* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. \n* [EndGame Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) covered the gamma squeeze, potential shady tactics by MMs, and some tips for staying safe. \n* [EndGame Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6y7om/gme_endgame_part_4_the_saga_continues/) covered the continued gamma squeezing and the resulting tenuous position of the \\~50M shorts that were still in GME. \n* [EndGame Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7clyl/gme_endgame_part_5_they_couldnt_win_so_they/) (deleted by mods, posted by someone else in comments) went into the implications of the absolute mindfuck trick the shorts pulled when they limited buying of GME (and other heavily shorted stocks)\n\n# Important External Reading\n\nThese three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**\n\n* Anatomy of a Short Attack - Seeking Alpha article from 2014. Can\u2019t link it. Search for it.

One of which is simply to ignore it. Another is to roll the position to another broker-dealer. Oftentimes, fails to deliver can last for months or years.

That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that **not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms**, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\u201d\n   * \u201cWho controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC\u2018s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.\u201d**\n\n# History of shares and shorts on $GME\n\nHere\u2019s some history on GME that\u2019s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. \n\n* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME\u2019s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)\n\n* **GME used to be in the S&P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It\u2019s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&P.** \n* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78\n\n* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772\n\n* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  \n* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. \n* **There are many strange connections between DTCC\u2019s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood\u2019s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood\u2019s users had GME. \n   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.\n   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a \u201cturn off buying or else\u201d kind of arrangement. \n   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn\u2019t care about shooting down Robinhood. It\u2019s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. \n   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \\- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it \n      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you\u2019d know something interesting.** \n\n# Why GME went up\n\n* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. \n   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there\u2019s **high trading volume relative to total float**, it\u2019s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. \n   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) \n   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: \n      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was\n      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more\n      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them\n      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME \n   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That\u2019s why GME shot up. \n\n# The Big Reset\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. \n\n* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It\u2019s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. \n* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. \n\n# However, this is not the end for GME\n\n* Everything started with value on GME\n   * At $50, we\u2019re back to a value play. GME\u2019s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)\n   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we\u2019re not too far off from that right now. \n   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink \n* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) \n   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He\u2019s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he\u2019s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. \n      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen\u2019s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. \n   * **Regulatory involvement.** It\u2019s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. \n   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it\u2019s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. \n   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn\u2019t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. \n      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood\u2019s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on \u201cdowngrade\u201d under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** \n\n# How I\u2019m thinking about GME now \n\nThis is going to sound extremely strange, but **I\u2019ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can\u2019t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn\u2019t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I\u2019m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. \n\nNone of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of \u201cGME is another blockbuster destined for death\u201d is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. \n\nSince part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). \n\nI believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don\u2019t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m hoping for a further dip. I\u2019m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. \n\n# Suggestions \n\nThis is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. \n\nHere\u2019s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. \n\n* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that\u2019s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I\u2019m selling calls against my remaining shares. \n   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \\~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don\u2019t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of \u201cpennies in front of a steamroller\u201d but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**\n      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). \n      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. \n      * Two scenarios:\n      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d.\n      * \u201cDownside\u201d risks:\n* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don\u2019t fomo. \n* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it\u2019s an **attack vector** for you. \n* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn\u2019t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you\u2019re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. \n* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don\u2019t pay you for it, margin call you when you\u2019re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don\u2019t think the \u201cfree\u201d commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.\n* **Minimize regret; don\u2019t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares \u201cearly\u201d on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for \u201cmaximum profit\u201d led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.\n* **Don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I\u2019ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I\u2019ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. \n* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It\u2019s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you\u2019ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. \n* **Don\u2019t sell on dips.** You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.\n* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do your own DD. I\u2019m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.\n\n# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?\n\nOn February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I\u2019d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. \n\n## Dear Vlad,\n\n1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?\n\n2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?\n\n3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?\n\n4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME\n\n5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME\u2019s price rise again to $500/share or more? \n\n## Dear Kenny G,\n\n1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?\n\n2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?\n\n3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?\n\n4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?\n\n5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME\n\n6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?\n\n## Dear Plumpkin,\n\n1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity\n\n2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back\n\n3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt\n\n4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th\n\n5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital\n\n6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?\n\n7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?\n\n8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME\n\n9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise\n\n10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-\"R\"-T when they closed their short gme positions\n\n11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?\n\n12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?",

        "title": "A hedge fund managers perspective on GME",
        "text": "I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  \n\nGME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?\n\n1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.\n2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.\n3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  \n4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.\n5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other \"value\" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the \"hard to borrow\" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.\n\nImpossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.\n\nFor what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",

        "text": "Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,\n\nFirst \u2013 Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon\n\n**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**\n\n**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \\*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My opinion** is that Shorts don\u2019t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don\u2019t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \\*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \\*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. \u201cParticipants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in \u2018threshold securities\u2019 if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.\u201d \\[SEC Rule 204\\] (link below)\n\n**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \\*of failure to deliver\\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**\n\n**\\*\\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 & 6 at bottom for more details.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I\u2019M NOT FUCKING SELLING!\n\n**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**\n\n\\- Read below here if you can or care.\n\n1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?\n\nShorts weren\u2019t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn\u2019t good for them, but it isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \\*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\nIt takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \\*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\\*\n\nSo, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.\n\n2. How does that help the shorts?\n\nLower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.\n\nShorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.\n\n3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?\n\nI don\u2019t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.\n\n4. We\u2019ve heard this before. So what?\n\nI agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don\u2019t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\n~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.<- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don\u2019t count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \\*some of\\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \\*their own\\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se\n\n**Threshold Securities**\n\nDef: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for\n\n\u00b7 Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and\n\n\u00b7 Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and\n\n\u00b7 Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer\u2019s total shares outstanding.\n\nIf you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.\n\nRelevant links\n\nSEC - [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\nSee rule 204 \u201cClosing-out Requirements\u201d\n\nEdit: 'We must hang together or surely we shall all hang separately.' - maybe some smooth brain that has his face on money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   \"The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security\" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.\n\nSourced from [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235\\_88503](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235_88503)  \\- relevant section can be located with the find tool and typing \"98\". For me, it is 1 of 18. Clicking the 98 hyperlink will take you to a written example provided by the SEC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: If you feel this doesn't matter because the SEC won't enforce it then please consider contacting your representatives. Rules and regulations should be enforced. We can't encourage a lack of action just because things are hard or more complicated than we thought they would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**\n\nIn the post, I refer to \"The Shorts\" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.\n\n**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**\n\n~~Strikethrough~~ (removed) , \\* (added), and \"edit #\" are used to mark changes.",

        "text": "Let\u2019s break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when it\u2019s time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? \n\nAMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.\n\n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.",

You think I want to watch a gem like Frozen 2 on small bitch ass 60 inch TV screen with shitty ass TV speakers? No. I WANT THAT FUCKING BASS REVERBERATING THROUGH MY TESTIES AND IT TICKLE MY ANUS. Thats some good shit. I ain't getting this shit at home. My wife doesn't like losers who watch movies on small ass TV screens. That's why she's with her boyfriend right now. \n\nSecondly, I don't have a fucking fountain soda machine in my house. Im a poor retard who is trying to make a living like Steve Cohen. Nothing is better then sippin' that sweet carbonated nectar with a big fat bin of popcorn or a god damn pretzel. I also don't have an arcade section to kill time. SOME EVEN HAVE BARS. \n\nThirdly, this shit is 13$ right now. Severely under valued.    Its not the company's fault that shit stains suppressed this stock for years and prevented further growth. Its not the company's fault that covid fucked its business right in the ass. \n\nBut guess what, we have vaccines now! Covid is far from over but its only a matter of time until our wives respect us by watching \ud83d\ude80 Man on big ass fucking screens like we \ud83e\udd8d are supposed to. \n\nThey are embracing streaming like the chads they are:\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357883/amc-universal-disney-streaming-warner-bros-mulan-tenet-theaters-movies\n\nChicago is opening up more theaters and as restrictions are lessened more will open up:\n\n\nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/amc-to-open-35-more-movie-theaters-across-illinois-friday/2423859/\n\nThey cut into their debt which means NO BANKRUPTCY!\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive-idUSKBN29Y03C\n\nThis is a 40$ stock, at the very least and when they're clicking on all cylinders it can go even FURTHER BEYOND.

I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it\u2019s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it\u2019s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.\n\n**GME** \\- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**BB** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don\u2019t sell.\n\n**AMC** \\- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn\u2019t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.\n\n**NOK** \\- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was \u201cbot\u201d propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.\n\n**Defining some terms:**\n\n**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)\n\n**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day\n\n**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)\n\n**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)\n\n**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n\\-Where did I get this chart from?

        "title": "AMC \"BULL TRAP\"",
        "text": "Watch out for hedge funds \"Bull Trap\".\n\nHello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.\n\nLet just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's \"Bull Trap\" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the \"Short Squeeze\". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?\n\nExample:\n\nOn January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the \"bull trap\".\n\nI don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.\n\n\"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.\"\n\nThe approval of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.\n\nA new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.\n\nDo NOT Sell my friends.",

        "title": "Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC",
        "text": "I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.\n\nTheir reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout \"market manipulation\" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).\n\nThe first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:\n\nMy screenshot (02/05/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98\n\nThe short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.\n\nRegardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on \"updating data\".\n\nI presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.\n\nHowever, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.\n\nRight, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.\n\nMy screenshot (02/06/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3\n\nAs you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).\n\nIn April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.\n\nI get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?\n\nThere was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff\n\nHere's the email he received.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7\n\nAgain, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.\n\nThoughts.\n\nP.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.\n\nP.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!\n\nEdit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn\u2019t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.\n\nAre you certain the chart isn\u2019t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I\u2019ll resolve your ticket but I\u2019m still here if you reply.\"\n\nI mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say \"oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more \"accurate\" measurements to our users\". Ya know?\n\n**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**\n\n**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.\n\nHis post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**\n\nAnd for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3\n\nThis is their response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5\n\nSo their excuse is a \"programming error\". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).\n\nI'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.",

Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers.... the body I\u2019ve lost... the comrades we\u2019ve all lost... won\u2019t stop hurting... it\u2019s like they\u2019re all still there. You feel it too, don\u2019t you?\n\nCurrently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I\u2019ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we\u2019ll see a rebound. So I\u2019ll keep holding\n\nPosition: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too\n\nEdit: stop telling me to sell. I\u2019m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake\n\nEdit 2: to the guy who said \u201cAMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat\u201d but who\u2019s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it\u2019ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there\u2019s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less\n\n\nEDIT3: **Were going up after hours +2.18%** this is it boys *and girls*, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $420.69, here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "text": "To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :\nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) \n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. \n\nToday\u2019s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)\n\nSo Monday when they\u2019re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. \n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there\u2019s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we\u2019re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday \n\nMy recommendation: \n1. HOLD\n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it\u2019s going to violently rise\n3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it\u2019s highest.",

Keep in mind, AMC\u2019s float is significantly larger than GME and with lower short interest so I don\u2019t expect another insanely parabolic move but this bet maximizes pay off if we somehow repeat. And if the selling pressure alleviates and we take off, another gamma squeeze is on the table. \n\nTldr: long 2/5 AMC 40 strike calls at 1.25/contract.\n\nEdit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 GME & AMC \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. I am expecting downvotes, I\u2019ll take them, but just wanted to share my play.\n\nEdit 2: I am receiving a lot of feedback which promotes continued long and concentration in GME and I would like to share some updates on why I think staying long GME is warranted and important. Based on latest data, as of today, AMC short interest is around 41% versus GME short interest around 95%. AMC SI increased day over day versus GME SI decreasing marginally day over day. Put differently, GME short positions are hurting more and has a higher probability of capitulation. Put retardedly, stay max long GME to secure tendies.",

So please take what I say here with a grain of salt.

A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. \n\nHe likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.\n\nAMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. \n\nBoth of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.\n\nAll we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.\n\nITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.\n\n**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**\n\nHere we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. \n\nAMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.\n\nEDIT: HERE ARE LINKS TO THE AQUISITIONS\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/89919?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n https://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/55225?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/28949?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/87923?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nhttps://bulletin.webull.com/20210317/158812/43661662a0bb76607f86a5bcb4708c19/82461?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&hl=en&theme=1\n\nThese are just a few. There are more.\n\nBelow is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!\n\nRemember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:\n\n1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.\n\n2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing \"Emergency Relief\" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) \n\n3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)\n\n4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.\n\n5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. \n\n6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.\n\n7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. \ud83d\ude80\n\n8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. \n\n\nWe're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.\n\nI'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.\n\nTo the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. \n\nTo all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are. \n\n\n\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\\[rocketemoji\\]\n\nEDIT: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n\nEdit 2: Less retarded format\nEdit 3: FUND-A-LINGUS",

Actively traded by young traders**\n\n**\\[UPDATE Jan 28\\] ALL THIS PRESSURE ON ROBINHOOD AND OTHER FRAUD CASINO APPS TO REOPEN TRADING RESTRICTIONS TOMORROW WILL CAUSE OUR STONKS TO EXPLODE LIKE PENT UP DIARRHEA \ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b\ud83c\udf0b**\n\nHouse always wins but not if we all unite and fight against it. Restricting our baby penny $SNDL from trading was truly a blessing in disguise. It has now caught the attention of the mass media and we're getting free coverage along with $GME, $AMC etc. Even Dave Portnoy (Barstool guy) is ticker tagging $SNDL on his tweets who is also in the center of all this sh!tstorm.\n\nSo with that said, we launching this rocket very soon! BTFD but most importantly **DON'T F\\*CKNG SELL!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*I'm not a financial advisor",

This normally isn't enough to do much- but add in some magical ingredients including but not limited to: highly volatile stocks, heavy retail interest, significant short interest, a small float, inclusion in ETFs, INDEX FUNDS and other FUNDS.\n\nAs the price rises close to the strike price we also see some gamma spiking. Personally I think we saw delta hedging yesterday on Blackberry. Huge volumes around 11am.\n\nSo, PEOPLE, have discovered that just buying these heavy options, especially around volatile times, can influence the price likely more dollar-for-dollar than just buying the stock. It might be that many WSBers are literally in the right place at the right time.\n\n**What does it all mean?** Hang onto your bananas. This thing is bigger than us. If the prices on some of these stocks rise they will need to be re-calibrated for weight for inclusion in their index funds. This creates a lot of buying and selling which exasperates the volatility further. The more volatility the more market makers have to hedge.\n\nI think we are in for a once in a life time historical volatile ride. If you hold stock, you can ride it out and better time it. If you hold options you are really hoping your timing works well.\n\nSomething BIG is going to happen leading up to March 19th and the way the call contracts are organized creates a kind of series of landmines just waiting to be tripped. Each mine sends the price further and more volatile. What's more interesting is these stocks all seem to be related in a basket by the algo-computers. This does mean there is some degree of echo where what happens in AMC affects BB for instance. It might mean we see some double feedback happening as well. We did see it originally in January (and no one has been able to explain exactly WHY yet). I think January was a test... A proof of concept. The real prize is March 19th.\n\n**GOOD LUCK...**\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. This is for informational and entertainment purposes only. The thoughts herein are my own. Do your own research. Do something nice for someone today.\n\nPositions: I have some BB, NOK, calls and want to pick up some RKT calls and YOLO today. They're way up pre-market and looks like it's going to be expensive... but I particularly like this one due to the high insider ownership, stagnant pricing, low float, reasonable price volatility. This ones just primed.\n\n**OOF, just cheeked $PLTR March 19th and it's massive too.**\n\nA lot of moon landings coming!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfmpnvks2mk61.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e770c819e38af3b605bb07d2268557a4d5756d\n\nOn a last thought... What if GME is the catalyst for the next major crash by it's revealing of naked-shorts and fails to deliver? 2008 was all about Wall Street greed with mortgage backed securities... 2021 could be all about naked shorting and naked options writing... All meaning wall street has done it again by absorbing insane amounts of risk pursuing profits. This might all come to a head and create some systemic change that will benefit all. Damn, I'm feeling rather noble now about my own pursuits.  \n\n\n**EDIT: March 3 2:19... I made a mistake when taking the screen shot on GME March 19th. This wasn't a conspiracy....**  \n",

        "text": "People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.\n\nSort by VOLUME\n\n$GME  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)  \n29,097 contracts @ $800  \n10,905 contracts @ $200  \n10,418 contracts @ $150\n\nThis is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.\n\n$BB  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)  \n6,665 contracts @ $11  \n2,483 contracts @ $12  \n1,692 contracts @ $10.50\n\n$AMC  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc)  \n43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!  \n27,299 contracts @ $9  \n26,471 contracts @ $10\n\nThey can't let the price above $8!\n\n$NOK  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok)  \n4,064 contracts $4  \n3,417 contracts $4.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:  \n**AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**  \n**NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**  \n**GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**  \n**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**\n\nOption holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.\n\nThis does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).\n\nIt is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.\n\nThere is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.\n\nAMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.\n\nBB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.\n\nNOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.\n\nCatalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).\n\nEveryone have a great weekend.\n\nDisclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: fucked formatting",

        "text": "**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst off this message is not financial advice. I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.\n\nAMC is hyped and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.\n\nHere they are:\n\n* FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze\n* Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing\n* COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%\n\nI repeat this is not financial advice and I don't want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.\n\nIf you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.\n\nLove you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away! Go get them apes!\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/amc](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc?mod=quote\\_search](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc?mod=quote_search)\n\n[https://www.amctheatres.com/on-demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/on-demand)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT 1:  I forgot to mention that AMC just released their own streaming service that will allow you to watch blockbuster movies from you home. Having a streaming platform could work as an additional catalyst for gains.\n\nEDIT 2:  I accidently linked the wrong AMC streaming service.\n\nEDIT 3:  I updated the earning report release date and added links to AMC MarketWatch and Fintel data\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt looks like the squeeze is starting to happen!

        "title": "Why I'm super happy to watch evil hedgies shave 1/3 of GME and AMC",
        "text": "Hello WSB, this is my first official post, but I'm very proud to see how we have all HODL together really strong.\n\nI have been in GME since 30 Oct 2019 with an additional 1670 shares on 29 May 2020 and I wish I could take a screenshot to prove my words, but my custodian account does not allow any screenshots out of \"security\" reasons. I currently hold over 6 digits of value in GME and I hope to reach my 7 digits and possibly 8. After what happened today, my 7 digits is certain, 8 digits possible. With more crayons maybe I'll reach 9.\n\nThat being said I like to share and encourage with everyone why this nosedive drop we seen today is actually the BEST affirmation we really need.\n\nThere's been wonderful DD that the Short interest are still extremely high and that the data in FINRA is entirely unreliable. Let's be honest, before what happened today, no matter how certain we are, we weren't 100% sure.\n\nI'm an expert in Chinese history, and I'll quote Sun Tzu, the famed author recognised for writing the Art of War over 2000 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nTruth is we never really knew what the hedges were up to and this week was really fishy, with the absence of obvious short ladders and peaceful markets. Other than occasional dips everyday after reaching a peak, we couldn't tell much. Some people have speculated that maybe the hedges were buying calls in order to reduce their risks, but I think we can all agree now that there is a good possibility that the dips we've been seeing the last few days are just a test for hedges to see how much the price can be affected.\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, that was a coordinated attack. I have no idea how long they have planned that, but looking from what we've seen, it's definitely a lot of time. At that scale it's not possible for 1 or 2 hedge funds to pull this off by themselves. And YET!! This is where we recovered strong.\n\nSo what this means is this. The hedges are panicking. They are worried. And they have proven that the shorts *HAVE NOT BEEN COVERED*. If they have been covered to the large extent they claimed to, today's coordinated attack wouldn't have happened.\n\nNot just did they admit with their actions that they are fearing us, they also basically highlighted to us what stocks they are all massively shorting. AMC, KOSS, NOK, BB all are in this together with us GME Army! \n\nYou know it's like Harry Potter, where Voldemort basically handed the weapons to Harry by his own hands.\n\nBased on Chinese History, there's this clever strategist Sun Tzu. For him before he executes any clever maneuvers for war, he will always test them first. If the hedges we are up against are the same smooth brain people like Sun Tzu, this fall is only a test. But it's costly to them and we have held strong. With the current prices, supposing they did buy some shares to cover their losses, all those buys from 180 to 250 are all gone. Now they are forced to buy shares above 260 and its only going to cost them even more. Much better for us.\n\nFellow apes, they are really afraid of our gamma squeeze this week and next week.\n\nNow... We strike back, by doing NOTHING!\n\nEdit:\n[to the skeptics who need proof for everything](https://imgur.com/a/aTaF8j6)\n\nI obviously have better things than to post everything on social media like a attention seeking person. I'm a retarded ape not a peacock. Your tongues will wag too no matter what even if my picture has shown my platform to be ancient. But that's nothing to do with my investing preferences. \n\nFor you skeptics who need proof for everything and choose to always doubt and flake, here it is. \"A confident man does not live for the applause and approval of the non-worthy\". Your skeptical outlook has only said to me that you clearly did not see Gamestop for what it really was earlier on, and even if DFV's DD was shown to you in those days, you were a late adopter. It has also shown me that you have the paper hands tendency when you don't see potential and when the going gets tough. \n\nI thought I have surpassed and ignored most silly comments, but thanks to the 1% of negative words, you have helped me see I still react to silly nonsense and it's something I need to change in myself. You are a Hyena and this is a community of apes. Reflect on yourselves.",

Just for reference **here is GME as of 3/6** \n\n[SUCCCC EM GOOD MELV](https://preview.redd.it/b0d01sugadl61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=829f8c5180b40b1a009072c0b201ba838ea807f5)\n\n**GME shorts are down to -23.7% from last month** (I don't believe this is accurate though with positions being actively covered) This is crazy, **one of the most talked-about shorted stalks on our page has gone up 27.6% in shorted volume in the past month and NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT?????** \n\n**THIS SEEMS ODDLY SIMILAR TO THE PAGE MANIPULATION SEEN WITH GME AFTER THE FIRST SPIKE, AND THE RANDOM FLOOD OF 10,000 NEW RKT BUYERS!**\n\n**Here is a link to Investopedia** (I know it's not the most reliable to normal humans but to apes, it's like the 10 commandments) [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp)\n\n**Why is this significant?** \n\n**1) It shows something is kinds of sketchy...** Our community is built on great investments and currently shorted positions, so **why would one of the biggest stocks only a few weeks ago all of a sudden just tapper off?** AGAIN THIS IS A THEORY, BUT I THINK THERE IS MANIPULATION GOING ON!!!\n\n**2) If the percentages are true, it seems that the HF have less to lose in AMC than they do in GME** at the moment. My guess is that they are in a sense t**aking the lesser of two giant peens in their ass.** *Why lose 50+ billion on AMC when you could manipulate the focus to GME and potentially see a greater loss.*\n\n**3) Did we not forget that AMC is not only the largest theater chain in the world but they are now starting to recover from a global pandemic that inhibited profits for nearly an entire year??** I mean I'm no **hedgefuck** but common sense tells me that going from relatively 0 profit for a year, to suddenly the chance of starting up at full capacity would cause a greater P/L ratio than 10%!!!!\n\n**4) AMC IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST SHORTED STOCKS ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!** I LOVE GME AND HAVE QUITE A BIT IN IT, BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN AND SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AS MUCH AS GME.\n\n**TL:DR: My theory is that HF are manipulating the page to divert attention from AMC to GME so that they don't have to cover TENS OF BILLIONS IN SHORTS. We have seen AMC stop following the same trends as GME in the past week, after weeks of being damn near the same graph. AMC continues to go up in % of volume shorted while GME is easing off short volume (IK WHY, BUT STILL LOOK AT MY POINTS) AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN APES!!!**\n\nI am not an advisor I just like the community...\n\n**ALSO GME TO THE MOON MF!!!! SMD SHITADALE**\n\n**WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK MAN!!!!** \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80",

        "text": "As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.\n\nAMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.\n\n****This is where we come in.****\n\nThe recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.\n\n>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.\n\n>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.\n\n>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.\n\n>It\u2019s been a wild ride for the nation\u2019s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.\n\nNow, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. \n\nThis movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. \n\nAnd the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. \n\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.\n\nThis is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",

This sub has gone from YOLOing everything you have into GOEV and losing it, posting the loss porn, and taking your losses like a man to essentially an insider trading, mass manipulation mission where the retard levels get so dense it creates a black hole of autism that causes people to dump their grocery money on the early peak of a squeeze.

        "text": "AMC has in my opinion officially decoupled from GME. I don't see as many posts, or as many comments regarding the DD or discussions on the potentials AMC poses as a short squeeze target. It's sad to see how many of you disbanded for quick bucks on other shit tickers. \n\nHere are some cold facts about AMC:\n\n1. AMC Short Interest is now a whopping +10%\n2. The OI on options expiring 3/19 are ENORMOUS. The value is nearly HALF that of Apples.\n3. AMC is still a massively shorted stock, one of the most in the whole market. \n4. AMC is reopening dozens and dozens of cinemas tomorrow in many cities: one of the biggest being in San Francisco.\n5. The fucking FUNDAMENTALS haven't changed! AMC & GME have ALWAYS been the cause. We LIKE these stocks. \n\n>inb4 here are bearish hard cold facts on AMC.\n\nI just came back today from the cinema for the first time in a long ass time. And it felt GREAT. The feeling of having people laugh alongside you, the thrill of grabbing popcorn and sinking into the leather chairs, watching a new release on a big screen. Fuck the Netflix. That's for lazy zoomers who want instant depressing gratification. So fuck the bearish sentiment on AMC. I don't care. I support our cinemas with my cash, and will fucking HOLD until you apes eventually come back to your original mission. \n\nTLDR: Everyone seems to have forgotten about AMC to chase quick bucks on PLT, RKT, SKX and other shit tickers and have forgotten where they began. AMC is still not done. It never really began in the first place, yet. Stay the course.",
